<p>Hi, I’m Rob. This is my small corner of the web. I’m a software engineer located in Madison, WI. I’ve built software at places like 
  <a href="https://simple.org">Simple.org</a>, </a><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://cognitect.com/">Cognitect</a>, and 
  <a href="https://seekingalpha.com">Seeking Alpha</a>. I also do consulting and contract work via my own company Sanheim Software.
</p>

<p>
  When I’m not on computers I hike, read, do dad things with my kids, listen and play all sorts of music, and try to appease my ridiculous <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/2ccAkZwgrn/">dog</a>.
</p>

<p>You can follow me on the internet at <a href="https://twitter.com/rsanheim">twitter</a> or 
  <a href="https://github.com/rsanheim">GitHub</a>.  My email is <code class="highlighter-rouge">rsanheim</code> at gmail dot com.
