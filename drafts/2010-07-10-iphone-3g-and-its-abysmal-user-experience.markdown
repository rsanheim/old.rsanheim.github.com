This nails it.  I'm a fairly happy Iphone 3G owner, but even before upgrading to iOS 4 the performance was becoming horrendous.  We are talking three or four seconds to do things or get a keyboard to enter input.  After the iOS 4 upgrade, it seems to have gotten even worse.



The iPhone experience for me is still as close to magic as technology can come these days.  I'm a pretty happy owner of the iPhone 3G, though lately the speed and responsiveness of the interface has been pretty much horrendous.  Even before the iOS 4 update, it was getting bad -- 3 or 4 seconds to change apps or to have the UI bring up the keyboard for input.
