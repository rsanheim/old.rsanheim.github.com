Its a anti Java bonanza!!

Cover your ipod in a flame retardant suit, because DHH has an <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail658.html">interview</a> (<a href="http://www.itconversations.com/audio/download/ITConversations-658.mp3">direct mp3 link</a>) up on <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/">ITConversations</a> entitled "Secrets Behind Ruby on Rails".  If you are web 2.0 compliant, go to the <a href="http://www.odeo.com/channel/193/view/">odeo channel</a> to grab it (tho it hasn't refreshed yet).

The secrets go something like this:
<ol><li>Create innovative web framework</li>
<li>Incite Java and PHP web developers to do your marketing for you</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>

Also, Paul Graham has <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisptext.html">posted <i>On Lisp</i></a> in its entirety.  I read some of this at Borders the other day and it seemed like a very good intro to the language.  Concise (under 400 pages not counting the reference), and easy to read.
