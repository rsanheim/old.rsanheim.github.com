Today the wife and I start a new diet. I like to think of it as the "eat less and don't be fat" diet. Basically, we can't eat carbs after 11, and before 11 all carbs must be good. No donuts, no refined grains, etc. After 11 its basically low to no carbs - basic salads, lean meats, fish, protein shakes, soy/veggie protein, etc. Its simple, its easy, and it will work fine to start. We get one free meal a week to indulge ourselves, which should allow us to "live a little".

I figure this will allow us to eat some healthy fruits/whole grains in the morning to get started, and still limit our tendancy to binge on crap at night. The only thing I'm worried about is that it might be harder for our self-control to have some carbs in the morning and then cut them out for the afternoon. The blood sugar spike could be nasty, and it might make things easier if we just sit in ketosis 24/7 (once we adjust, of course).

This should be fine for a start, though. Tonight we have to throw out or give away all the crap we have, so we don't have all sorts of temptations lying around.
