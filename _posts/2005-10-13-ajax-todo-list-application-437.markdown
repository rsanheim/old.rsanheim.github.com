The world obviously needs another to do list app, so  I saw that <a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> launched yesterday.  If you thought tada lists were way too stripped down, give this a try.  All sorts of features: tabbed lists, priorites, estimates, recurrance, feeds, sharing, iCalendar.  The look and feel is impressive on first impression - loading animation while lists are being retrieved, subtle use of effects, etc.  Everything seems to be very dynamic - I'm not sure if there is a full page reload anywhere.  Entering new items and editing them is very easy and straight forward, and you can enter "outlook style" dates like "tomorrow" or "next tuesday".  (thank goodness I can enter list items by just hitting "enter" - hear that 37 signals?!) Also has undo support for all sorts of stuff, which is pretty rare.

All the buzz lately is about <a href="https://37signals.com/svn/archives2/less_as_a_competitive_advantage_my_10_minutes_at_web_20.php">less</a>, of course, whether it be <a href="https://lesscode.org">less code</a> or just <a href="https://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.219431.39">less frameworks.</a>  Still, its good to have somebody trying to provide all those crazy features people clamor for.  I'll be sticking with <a href="https://www.basecamphq.com/">basecamp</a> as my general planner app, but lets see what Remember the Milk looks like in a few months.

(sidenote: anyone know what the infrastructure for it is?)
