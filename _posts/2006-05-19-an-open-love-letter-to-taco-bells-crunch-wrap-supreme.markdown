McSweeney's is pretty much the <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/openletters/3crunchwrap.html">perfect site for fridays.</a>

<blockquote>The second your tortilla met my lips, I knew there was no turning back. You had it all! In one compact package, no less. You had the flexibility of a flour tortilla, the firm crunch of a corn tortilla, the freshness of lettuce and tomatoes. Your patches of sour cream were necessary and well spaced. You had meat. Oh, did you have meat. And encompassing all of your features was that nacho-cheese sauce that I can't get enough of.</blockquote>
