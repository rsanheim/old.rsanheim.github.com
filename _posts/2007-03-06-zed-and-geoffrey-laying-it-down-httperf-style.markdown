I've been waiting for <a href="http://nubyonrails.topfunky.com/articles/2007/03/05/peepcode-page-caching-and-httperf">this screencast</a> for awhile.  Our team at <a href="http://seekingalpha.com">SeekingAlpha</a> has been doing a ton of work with load testing, performance, and optimization, in both Rails and PHP (ugh).  I've used httperf a bit but still don't feel like I really "get it".  Its great to see Zed and Geoffrey have combined forces to lay out how to do load testing *right*.  Or as Zed says:

<cite>...it is probably the first description of performance measurement and analysis I've seen that
actually gets it right.</cite>

For <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/benchmarking-with-httperf">nine crummy dollars</a>, how can you go wrong?  Thats like 1.5 triple venti skim no-whip mochas.  Score.
