title: Ruby and Ruby on Rails Book Roundup
excerpt: Explosion of the Ruby book market - at least sixteen books coming 2006!
wordpress_url: https://www.robsanheim.com/?p=205
---
<b>updated 5/1: added Rails in a Nutshell and Mr. Neighborly's book</b>
<b>updated 7/24: updated status on some released books, added the O'Reilly RJS book</b>
<b>updated 9/26: a bunch of books updated that have been released, including RoR: Up and Running, Java to Ruby, Enterprise Integration with Ruby, and Mr Neighborly's Humble Ruby Book.  Also added some links to reviews.</b>
 
The Ruby and Ruby on Rails book market is absolute <strong><a href="https://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/12/ruby_book_sales_surpass_python.html">exploding</a></strong>.       Its amazing to watch the market go from a slow trickle of books to <strong>sixteen</strong> upcoming books for 2006 - nine of them covering Rails specifically and seven on Ruby in general.

I'm a big <a href="https://www.librarything.com/profile/rsanheim">book nerd</a>, and I love Ruby, so here is my attempt at rounding up the current state of the market.  I'm not going to list older books that are out of date unless they are really notable.  For an older list, the <a href="https://hypermetrics.com/rubyhacker/clrFAQ.html">comp.lang.Ruby faq</a> has a <a href="https://hypermetrics.com/rubyhacker/clrFAQ.html#tag12">list.</a>

<b>Note:</b> Title hyperlinks go to the detail page at Amazon.  The "(@pub)" link next to the titles goes to the publisher's page on the book, if there was one available.

December 2006 should see the release of <a href="https://www.testing.com/">Brian Marick's</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=panasonicyout-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0977616614%2526tag=panasonicyout-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0977616614%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Scripting for Testers : Using Ruby</a> <a href="https://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/bmsft/index.html">(@pub)</a>, which I'm looking forward to for some coverage on <a href="https://wtr.rubyforge.org/">Watir</a>.  The release date on this has slipped from summer '06 to the end of the year, and there is no beta book available.  Ex-Java "hyper enthusiast" <a href="https://today.java.net/pub/au/186">Bruce Tate</a> will continue to stir up flame wars with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=panasonicyout-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0976694093%2526tag=panasonicyout-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0976694093%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Java to Ruby : Things Your Manager Should Know</a> <a href="https://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_j2r/index.html">(@pub)</a>.  Tate was recently interviewed for the <a href="https://podcast.rubyonrails.com/">Rails podcast</a>, where he talked about his upcoming Ruby books a bit.

<a href="https://www.slash7.com/">Amy Hoy</a> <a href="https://www.slash7.com/articles/2005/10/19/podcast-book">announced</a> late last year that she will be writing Ruby on Rails Right Brained Guide.  Also, <a href="https://brainspl.at/">Ezra Zygmuntowicz</a> <a href="https://brainspl.at/articles/2005/12/14/the-book-is-a-go">announced</a> his book on deployment and configuration with Rails has been accepted by the Pragmatic guys.  The <a href="https://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_deploy/index.html">page at the prag's site</a> lists a release date of Jan 2007.  I had a chance to review a chapter of it and it looks promising.  I haven't seen more info on these two at the Pragmatic site or Amazon.

Bruce Tate must be keeping busy, as he and Curt Hibbs have recently released<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=panasonicyout-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0596101325%2526tag=panasonicyout-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0596101325%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Ruby on Rails: Up and Running</a> <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/catalog/rubyrails/">(@pub)</a>.  Some of the advanced material will cover using Ajax with REST and handling legacy database schemas.  Not sure how this material will overlap with the Rails cookbook, or how this slim book (182 pages!) will compare with the Agile book.

<a href="https://www.robbyonrails.com/">Robby Russell</a> has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=panasonicyout-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0596101503%2526tag=panasonicyout-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0596101503%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Programming Rails</a> <a href="https://www.programmingrails.com/">(@pub)</a> with an unknown release date.
