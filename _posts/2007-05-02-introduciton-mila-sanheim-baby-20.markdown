Mila Caroline Sanheim was born last Monday, April 23rd at 9lbs, 6oz, 21 inches long.  She is very cute, very strong, and will definitely kick your ass.  She has been destroying us lately (well, my wife moreso) by demanding food every hour on the hour from about 2am to 6.  We now realize how very, very spoiled we were with our first baby, since he slept a solid seven hours a night almost immediately.  So far our son has be indifferent to the extreme with the new developments.

We are starting an honest to goodness "family blog" once Mephisto is all tuned up, so this blog will remain pretty much solely tech/biz related.
