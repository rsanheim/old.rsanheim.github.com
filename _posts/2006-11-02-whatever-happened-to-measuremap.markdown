title: Whatever Happened to MeasureMap?

It seems like ages ago that <a href="http://measuremap.com">Measure Map</a> was <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000855.html">acquired</a> by Google.  Is anything going to come of that?  I've had access to a beta account for awhile (not for this blog) and the simplicity and interface are wonderful - its pretty much the anti-Analytics.  Analytics looks and feels like a very "enterprisey" app, and not in a good way.  It has every option and tons of bells and whistles, but its just overkill for most blogs.  I just want to see views and popular content over time, and I want to be able to do it with that nifty slider that Measure Map has, dammit.

Are there any good comparable products?  Mint doesn't count, I just want a drop in javascript solution.
