I noticed in the past day or two, he went from a nasty white-text on black background theme to the much nicer theme he has now.  He also went in and added line breaks to <a href="https://gladwell.typepad.com/gladwellcom/2006/02/mea_culpa.html">this post,</a> which was pretty much unreadable before.  Its good to see that he is reading feedback and responding to it, something it seems <a href="https://jameshowardkunstler.typepad.com/clusterfuck_nation/">other</a> author bloggers don't do.
