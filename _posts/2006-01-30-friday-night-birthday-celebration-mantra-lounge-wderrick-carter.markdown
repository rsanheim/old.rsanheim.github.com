Friday night I'll be celebrating my 27th birthday (belatedly) in Milwaukee at <a href="http://www.mantralounge.net/">Mantra Lounge.</a>  The legendary house dj <a href="http://www.thedjlist.com/djs/DERRICK_CARTER/">Derrick Carter</a> will be spinning for Mantra's <a href="http://www.mantralounge.net/getArtist.do?artistID=64&jsp=/artistDetail.jsp">two year anniversary</a> (event @<a href="http://upcoming.org/event/37522/">upcoming</a>), and it will certainly be a good ole' time.  Carter plays house music the way it was meant to be played, and you can't beat the price.

Even though I'm almost an old man, I can still "cut a rug" as the kids say.  If you are in the MKE area come out and have a drink with me.
