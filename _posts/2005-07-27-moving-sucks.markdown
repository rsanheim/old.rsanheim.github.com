We've been cramming all our belongings into a <a href="https://www.pods.com">pod</a> the last few days and shipping the rest off to the in-laws house.  I think I was up till midnight two nights ago and 3 am last night.  We finally have the entire house cleaned and emptied out - now there are just a few random things sitting in the garage.  Its amazing how much stuff you can accumulate without even realizing it.  I thought we had gotten rid of a lot during the first "cleansing" but the amount of junk we had just kept coming.  We really need to focus on keeping the clutter down on the new house, because the last few days have just been ridiculous.
