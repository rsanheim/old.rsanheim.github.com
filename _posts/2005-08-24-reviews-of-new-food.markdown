I've been away from McSweeny's too long.  Many good things here: <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/newfood/">Reviews of New Food</a>.

from Onion Sprouts: <em>So, with your box safely stowed in its own plastic Safeway bag, I take you home, fully prepared to honor my hunger with your goodness. I load you on my sandwichâ€”a boring bologna accompanied by an uneven tomato slice and plain-Jane cheese. I think even the thin layer of mustard coating the insides of my sliced white cannot compare to you.

Now I have learned. Oh. Have. I. Learned. </em>
