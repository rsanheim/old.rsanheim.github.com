Its pretty exciting to see a <a href="http://jruby.sf.net/">JRuby</a> <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/01/were-going-to-san-francisco.html">talk accepted</a> at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/index.jsp">JavaOne 2006</a>.  At least someone at Sun <a href="http://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/001125.html">gets it about alternative dynamic</a> languages on the JVM.  This is at least one good reason to stick around after the <a href="http://theajaxexperience.com">Ajax Experience</a> for JavaOne.

This part of the abstract is particularily compelling:

<blockquote>We plan for JRuby to run all the high-visibility Ruby applications in concert with existing Java applications and frameworks. Imagine Rails with JDBC ActiveRecord connectors, session or entity beans implemented in Ruby, middle-tier Ruby-based business rule engines, or building your application using the elegant Rake build tool. JRuby will help both Ruby and the JVM language benefit from all these possibilities.</blockquote>
