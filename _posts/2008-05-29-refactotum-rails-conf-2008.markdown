I'm in Portland for Rails Conf with over 80% of the <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/about" title='see our ugly mugs'>Relevance crew</a>.  We were testing out our "plane number" yesterday, but thank goodness American didn't let us down.

We'll be speaking today at about how to contribute to open source at <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/schedule/detail/2101">Refactotum</a> from 1:30 to 5.  We will cover some tools to help you find the code with the most technical debt, go over example refactorings, and then spend the rest of the session going from project to project and helping out as folks hit obstacles.  Please bring a laptop with any projects checked out that you'd like to hack on during the session (git preferred but not necessary). 

Hope to see you there!
