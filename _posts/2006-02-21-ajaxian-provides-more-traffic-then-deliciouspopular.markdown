Well, it might just be one data point, but the guys at <a href="http://alwaysbeta.com">alwaysbeta</a> saw more traffic from <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/lightboxjs-with-moofx">our post</a> on their lightbox mod then from getting on the front page of <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular">del.icio.us/popular</a>.

My theory is that noone really browses <a href="http://del.icio.us/">delicious</a> for random sites - its primarily a service used by nerds, and as nerds we all use the bookmarklets or extensions.  I know if I'm visiting delicious, its for a specific tag or tag intersection, or I'm just looking over what I've added to <a href="del.icio.us/rsanheim">my account</a> in the last couple of days.  Usually I'll go to digg, slashdot, or memorandum before I go to the del/popular page.

My second theory is that its too hard to get the del.icio.us URL right.  I can't tell you how many times I've had the periods in the wrong place.  Stupid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack">domain hacks.</a>
