The Ajax presentation <a href="https://www.jameshalberg.com">Jim</a> and I are presenting is <a href="https://www.robsanheim.com/Ajax/">online.</a>  Its come quite a ways from the original one we gave to <a href="https://www.madjug.org">MadJUG</a>, and is still a work in progress.

The examples are <a href="https://www.robsanheim.com/Ajax/">here</a>, and the slides are in S5 (ie xhtml & css) format <a href="https://www.robsanheim.com/Ajax/do/presentation/">here.</a>  I still need to get a link to the source code up.  These slides will be changing quite a bit before our talk on Sunday at <a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff.com">no fluff</a>, and I also need to get the Rails examples up.  Right now the slides content is still very much about DWR compared with JSON-RPC-Java, plus Echo2, but the focus is shifting away from JSON and more towards Echo and Rails.

Comments and feedback is appreciated.
