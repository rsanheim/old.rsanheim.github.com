title: "Six Months at Github"
---

TODO marks my six month anniversary at GitHub.  It has been a pretty amazing ride so far, 
so I thought I would take a bit of time to reflect on lessons learned and the most significant that make
GitHub unique amongst software development shops.  I would be remiss to not mention Brandon Keepers
excellant post on his experiences on GitHub after xxx months.

## Great People above all else

The quality of people at GitHub enables every other unique and powerful thing
about our company.  We don't need deadlines, top down management, or much in the way of
rules or process **because** GitHubbers are self motivated, smart, and
passionate.  While it is nice to imagine a world where more companies could be
like GitHub and optimize for happiness above else, the reality is that you
need people whose happiness is derived from creating a great product for that
to work.

The level of talent at GitHub drives me to consistently up my
game, whether it is trying to better understand C and Unix to dive deeper into
the GitHub backend, or refresing my TDD & OO chops to ensure I am constantly
improving the codebae everytime I touch it.

## GitHub Hiring?

GitHub hires great people.  We put a lot into hiring and screening of
candidates.  That doesn't mean draining, three day interviews with 
comp sci heavy interviews, where upper level GitHubbers yell at you while you try to implement 
Quicksort on a whiteboard.  There was a bit of coding in my interview, but it
was actually just pairing on the actual GitHub codebase, working on a real
problem that Matt Todd happened to be working with that day.  It was really
just an exercise to see how I approached solving problems and worked with
other people, as by the time you get past screening it is assumed you know how
to write Ruby or C or whatever.

## Culture of Shipping

One thing that particularly strikes me about GitHub is our culture of
shipping.  Even when it comes to larger architectural concerns, or blog posts,
or design ideas, shipping beats words or ideas everytime.  What do I mean by
shipping?

* creating a pull request with a spike demonstrating a small piece of an
  architectural change
* writing a rough draft of a proposed blog post
* sketching a design on paper and uploading a picture of that design to a
  relevant issue or pull request

So while it can be valuable to have conversations about things like
architecture, our messaging, or design, we usually value concrete action, even
if it just fuel to move the conversation forward.  Often in software
development bikeshedding can lead to endless philosophical debates and useless
arguments driven by ego instead of practical value.  Focusing on actions that
lead to shippning cuts through that crap and pushes things forward.

## Anarchist Structure

Much is made of the flat, nearly non-existant managemnt style of GitHub.  
Yes, it really is true that you can work on whatever the fuck you want.  
Yes, that means that I could drop everything and work on neckbeard-enhancing Scheme
rewrite of github/github, but it reality that just doesn't happen.  It turns
out when you hire self motivated, talented people who want to work with other
really other good people, folks generally work on important stuff.  Bugs get
fixed and crummy things like grunt-work automation and difficult tests still
get written. And if those things get missed on the first pass, positive peer pressure ensures
that they get done on first review.
