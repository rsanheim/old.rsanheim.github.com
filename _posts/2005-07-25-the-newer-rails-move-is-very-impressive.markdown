I finally got around to watching the <a href="https://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000478.html">second Rails movie</a> this morning.  It really is very impressive as <a href="https://www.loudthinking.com">David</a> blasts through a web blog application from zero to very functional in 15 minutes.  No xml, no class path issues, and only one server restart - even with db schema changes.   If you haven't seen it yet you really should go take a look.  I don't want to think about how long it would take to do the same using the typical Java web framework stack.
