The registration for <a href="https://www.rubycentral.org/conference/">RubyConf 2006</a> has been opened <a href="https://www.regonline.com/101503">here</a> - I'm guessing it won't stay open long.  Only 240 seats this year.  There is also a waiting list, so even if things sell out its worth a shot.

update: It closed real quick...but I managed to get a ticket in time.
