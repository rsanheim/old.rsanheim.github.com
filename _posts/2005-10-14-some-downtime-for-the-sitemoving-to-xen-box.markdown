I'm probably going to have some downtime this weekend while my wonderful hosts, <a href="https://www.rimuhosting.com">rimuhosting</a>, move me to a <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">Xen</a> based VPS.  Hopefully back up on monday faster and bloggier then ever.  Have I mentioned that rimuhosting absolutely rock?  Their plans are <a href="https://rimuhosting.com/order/startorder.jsp">very reasonably priced</a>, and support is fantastic.  Highly recommended for whatever web development you want to do, whether its java or rails or python or static html.
