<a href="https://www.railsconf.com">RailsConf</a> registration was <a href="https://www.railsconf.org/articles/2006/02/02/registration-is-open">opened</a> late last week, and already <a href="https://weblog.rubyonrails.com/articles/2006/02/06/railsconf-65-of-the-seats-sold">80% of the seats</a> are sold out.  At $400, its a crazy value for a three day conference on a very hot topic.  The Guidebook is <a href="https://www.railsconf.org/articles/2006/02/07/the-rails-guidebook-is-now-officially-sold-out">already</a> sold out, and its a very cool pure-charity thing that the pragmatic guys are doing.
