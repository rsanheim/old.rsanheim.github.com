<blockquote>[...Rails] is better in some ways, but Seaside is better in other ways. I think it's just that Rails' strengths address problems that are particularly frustrating to developers right now.</blockquote>
Rails addressing the problem of updating a relational database from the web, while Seaside focuses on the problem of state management in the stateless world of http.
