<a href="https://www.vanderburg.org/">Glenn</a> wrote recently about <a href="https://www.vanderburg.org/Blog/Software/Languages/rails_vs_seaside.blog">how to decide</a> between Rails or <a href="https://seaside.st/">Seaside</a>.

<blockquote>[...Rails] is better in some ways, but Seaside is better in other ways. I think it's just that Rails' strengths address problems that are particularly frustrating to developers right now.</blockquote>
Rails addressing the problem of updating a relational database from the web, while Seaside focuses on the problem of state management in the stateless world of http.
