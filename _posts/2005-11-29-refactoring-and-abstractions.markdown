<a href="https://www.jameshalberg.com">Jim</a> has a good post about how <a href="https://jameshalberg.blogspot.com/2005/11/refactoring.html">much refactoring is appropriate</a>.  I've struggled with just how much abstraction to introduce in my code, especially if I know there will be less experienced developers working with it.  I'll have to give some thought on how to cover the topic in the presentations tonight and tomorrow.

Re: the presentations: tonight is Milwaukee, then Madison, then THE WORLD. See <a href="https://www.robsanheim.com/2005/11/09/presenting-better-software-through-refactoring-at-wisconsin-jugs/">my old entry</a> for more information on it.
