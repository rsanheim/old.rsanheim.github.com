How bout a Wednesday night meetup for those of us getting into town early for Rails Conf?  Lets do the <strong><a href="http://www.luckylab.com/">Luckly Lab Pub</a> at 8pm</strong>, its not too far from the conf center.  It has free wifi and I gues dogs are allowed, and the <a href="http://www.luckylab.com/html/ales.html">selection</a> looks good.

Check the <a href="http://www.robsanheim.com/2007/05/11/railsconf-2007-google-map/">map</a> for directions...
