Google has launched (or maybe relaunched) their web stat tool.  It was formerly called <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/urchin.html">Urchin</a> and used to be on a subscription basis.  Today it was rebranded as <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and relaunched free.  It integrates with their AdWords system if you are using that, or you can just it stand alone by including their javascript tag in your site.  For more info and discussion see the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051114-5563.html">ArsTechnica news item.</a>

I may have to sign up for it in a few days after the rush dies down, and see how it compares to ye' old <a href="https://awstats.sourceforge.net/">Awstats</a> tracking.
