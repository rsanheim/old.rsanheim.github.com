...and its a doozy.  It has a load of <a href="https://scottraymond.net/articles/2006/02/28/rails-1.1">new</a> features.  Some of the main features include <a href="https://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/UnderstandingPolymorphicAssociations">polymorphic associations</a>, <a href="https://www.matthewman.net/articles/2006/01/06/rails-activerecord-goes-through">"through"</a> associations, and <a href="https://www.codyfauser.com/articles/2005/11/20/rails-rjs-templates">RJS</a> <a href="https://rewrite.rickbradley.com/articles/2006/02/06/rjs-templates">templates</a>.

In personal Rails news, I have failed miserably trying to get <a href="https://rubyforge.org/pipermail/instiki-users/2005-October/000358.html">i2</a> setup on my rimuhosting account.  I think its time to try <a href="https://instiki.org/show/HomePage">instiki</a> on dreamhost, or maybe some sort of php based wiki (ick).  Rails deployment is still a huge pain, and I'm hoping Ezra gets <a href="https://brainspl.at/articles/2006/02/28/a-hint-of-whats-to-come">this</a> done real soon.
