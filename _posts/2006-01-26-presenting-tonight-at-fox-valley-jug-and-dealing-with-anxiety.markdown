            Nice timing to see a post over on <a href="https://presentationzen.blogs.com">Presentation Zen</a> about dealing with <a href="https://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/01/dealing_with_pr.html">presentaton anxiety.</a>  Tonight I'm doing the <a href="https://www.robsanheim.com/refactoring_presentation/">refactoring session</a> ad the Fox Valley JUG, just outside Green Bay.  Also perfect timing was the onset of a cold and horrible sore throat this week, but I'm sure I'll be fine by the things start up.  The two and half hour drive will give me some nice time to catch up on podcasts, as I'm a few <a href="https://javaposse.com/">Java Posse's</a> behind and one <a href="https://podcast.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a> also (though the Rails podcast is almost always painful to listen to, but I digress..).
