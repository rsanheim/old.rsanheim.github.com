I've <a href="https://www.robsanheim.com/2005/08/05/why-doesnt-gmail-have-a-delete-button/">complained</a> about this before, so I was pretty happy when I saw on on <a href="https://blog.eronj.com/2006/01/19/gmail-delete-button/">Ron's blog</a> that Gmail finally adding a delete button!  Of course, deleted messages still <a href="https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=32608&hl=en">hang around for 30 days</a>, buts at least I can just get of chain letters or duplicate messages without going through the drop down menu.

Also, I see that I recently crossed the gigabyte mark of my Gmail usage.  Still only 37%.  Guess I should join some more mailing lists...
