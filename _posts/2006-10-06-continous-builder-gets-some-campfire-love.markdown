title: Continous Builder gets some Campfire love

I noticed a <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/5222">recent check in</a> on the <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/timeline">Rails timeline</a> to the Continuous Builder plugin.  DHH has added Campfire integration - so now you can get notified in real time chat about the chump who broke the build, and then proceed to mock them.  

Peer pressure can be a powerful thing, so grab the <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.com/svn/rails/plugins/continuous_builder/">latest version</a> and put it to work.
