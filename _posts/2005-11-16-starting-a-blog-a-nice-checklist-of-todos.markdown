<a href="https://blog.lifebeyondcode.com/blog">Rajesh Setty</a> has a <a href="https://blog.lifebeyondcode.com/blog">great list of things to do</a> when starting a blog- would be helpful for newbies and also for oldsters to see if they have missed anything.  There are quite a few items on the list that I've been planning to do but haven't got around to yet (like adding the Feedburner link and working more on the <a href="https://www.robsanheim.com/about/">about</a> page.

One thing I think he missed: add your blog to topical aggregators, like <a href="https://www.javablogs.com">Javablogs</a> or <a href="https://planet.ajaxian.com/">Planet Ajaxian.</a>

What items do you think he missed?
