<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy</a> has had a great run of posts on building passion, marketing through teaching, and inspiring passion.  <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/09/you_can_outspen.html">Her latest entry</a> talks about how teaching is the number one way to create passionate users (and by extension, profit):

<blockquote><em>...people who want to learn more are more likely to want more of your tools, services, community, and "tribe/pride items" around whatever it is they're learning...</em></blockquote>

You can see this effect around many of the popular "brands" rapidly gaining mindshare in the Java open source area.  Look at Spring and all the <a href="http://www.springframework.com/training/">training efforts</a> going on, both by Interface 21 and independants like <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/au/186">Bruce Tate</a>, not to mention all the books.  Look at JBoss/Hibernate and you see a similiar thing.  And of course, Ruby on Rails is another perfect example.  The outpouring of articles and books around that community has been amazing.

In my own life I see many examples - when I was big into bodybuilding and fitness, I was a follower of Avant Labs and <a href="http://bodyrecomposition.com/">Lyle McDonald</a>, two very well known and respected figures in the internet fitness commuity.  Both are well known their hardcore educational resources, whether it be through Avant's <a href="http://magazine.mindandmuscle.net/">magazine and message board</a> or Lyle's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=manalangcom-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0967145627%2526tag=manalangcom-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0967145627%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">books.</a>  As I learned and became more dedicated, I bought Avant's supplements or Lyle's books and kept coming back.

So if you want to promote something - get good at it, get passionate, and then start teaching it and getting others passionate.  The community will follow.
