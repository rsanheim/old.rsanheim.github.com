So, <a href="https://blogs.opensymphony.com/webwork/2006/01/webwork_22_released_and_ready.html">WebWork 2.2</a> was just released, which makes heavy use of <a href="https://getahead.ltd.uk/dwr">DWR</a> and <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> javascript framework.  Struts is going to be <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/dev%40struts.apache.org/msg13815.html">merging with</a> WebWork as <a href="https://struts.apache.org/struts-action/index.html">Struts Action Framework</a>.  So does that mean that in a couple years everyone running Struts 2.0 will be using (or at least be able to use) Dojo + DWR by default?  

Thats a very nice market shared advantages for those two projects!  Maybe we'll see some Struts + Dojo vs Rails + Prototype smackdowns at conferences in a couple years after everything shakes out.
