I've put up the latest version of my <a href="http://www.robsanheim.com/Ajax/">Effective Ajax presentation</a> online that I gave at the <a href="http://cjug.org">Chicago JUG.</a>  All the demos are live, including the email validation demo using DWR and Spring.  You can also just go straight to download the Eclipse <a href="http://www.robsanheim.com/Ajax/resources/ajax_demo.zip">project zip</a> file.  Note that the zip file has all the dependancies, so its a 10 meg download.  If that is a big deal, I could just throw the source out on the web somehow so its easily viewable, but I figure 10 megs isn't too bad with broadband nowadays.  I was having some issues with tomcat crashing but since my host <a href="http://www.robsanheim.com/2005/10/14/some-downtime-for-the-sitemoving-to-xen-box/">moved me to a Xen box</a> its been smooth sailing, but if there are any issues please <a href="mailto:rsanheim@gmail.com">email me</a> or comment and let me know.
