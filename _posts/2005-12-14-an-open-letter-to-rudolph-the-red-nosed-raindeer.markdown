<a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/openletters/#RudolphtheRedNosedRei"><blockquote style="font-size: large; font-family: serif; color:blue; border-left: none">Please, Rudolph, think twice before doing another favor for Santa. Think about this: If you rearrange the letters in "Santa," what do you get? I don't think that's an accident.</blockquote></a>
