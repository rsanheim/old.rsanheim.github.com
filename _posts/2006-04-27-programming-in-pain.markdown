So it seems my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">RSI</a> is really acting up, which should't be surprising since I'm in a much different work environment and spending more time working from a laptop.  It was pretty bad last week, with tingling up and down my left arm, especially in my elbow.  A massuese friend of mine gave me a massage last week that helped for a bit, and recommended I get to a chiropractor since "T3 is way out of alignment".    I may get back to the guy who did some <a href="https://www.activerelease.com/">ART</a> for me before, as that seems to really help.

I ran out and got some ergonomic stuff and an elbow brace to try and help things, and so far it seems a bit better.  Also working on the posture - I need to get some sort of reminder program since its so easy to forget and end up slouching.  I'm taking a lot more "microbreaks" for <a href="https://www.will-harris.com/yoga/rsi.html">quick stretching</a>, and taking ibuprofen for the worse times.

Feeling pain shoot up and down your arm while typing is always scary when your livelihood comes from programming - so I'll just have to modify my habits to fight this again.  When I was consulting I had problems for awhile, but was able to fight it off through some modifications.  I'll have to do the same this time.
