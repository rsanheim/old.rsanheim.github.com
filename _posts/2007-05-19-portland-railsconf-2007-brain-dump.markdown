Since getting in Portland I haven't much time to sit down and think or really write, but here's a quick brain dump, as I have like 4 blog entries queued up that I'm finishing...

	<ul>
		<li>portland is a great city</li>
		<li>ive walked like 10 miles since Monday</li>
		<li>portland is kind of like a bigger madison, with about 10x as many homeless people</li>
		<li>the jupiter hotel is meh, but trendy (long story)</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>the actual conference is good &#8211; big &#8211; and o&#8217;reilly&#8217;ian (flashy)</li>
		<li>the breakfast at railsconf sucks</li>
		<li>everyone has macs, and women don&#8217;t like programming</li>
		<li>avi loves smalltalk and ze is hilarious</li>
                 <li>grendel's has great coffee</li>
	</ul>
