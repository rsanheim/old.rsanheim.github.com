My wife had a resolution for 2005 of "read 50 books".  With one month left she is about half way done.  Even though she won't make her resolution, I'm still pretty impressed with how much reading she is able to get done while balancing full time work and school.  If I had kept tracking of my reading for the last year I'm guessing it would be around twenty books or so, especially because some of the technical books I've read just take a long time to get through.

For next year I'd like to set fifty as my goal.  I don't thint thats too unreasonable, as a book a week is very reasonable if you can allocate maybe an hour a day to reading.  If I can balance reading technical and non-tech books at the same time, it shouldn't be too bad to try and do a technical book every month and non-nerd book every week and a half or so.  

So, how many books do you read a year?
