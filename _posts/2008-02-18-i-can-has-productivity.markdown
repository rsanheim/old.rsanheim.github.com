I'll be speaking at <a href="https://ruby.meetup.com/3/">Raleigh.rb</a> tomorrow on Productivity, Ruby, and how to get more stuff done.  Spend more time programming and less time reading about programming (or reading PerezHilton, if thats your poison).

If you are in the area you should come out and say hi.  Productivity is serious business.
