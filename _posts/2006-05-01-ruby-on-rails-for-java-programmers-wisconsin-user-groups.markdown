Tomorrow I'm presenting in <a href="http://wjug.org/wjug/nextmeeting.jsp">Milwaukee</a> and Wednesday in <a href="http://madjug.org/madjug/nextmeeting.jsp">Madison</a> on "Ruby on Rails for Java Programmers".  Its going to be a what I hope is a fair comparison between Rails and Java web development, highlighting the sweet spots for Rails and areas where its not currently the best choice.

After these two talks, I think I'm going to put the presentations on hold for awhile.  I'd like to just have my <a href="http://www.seekingalpha.com/">work</a> to concentrate on awhile, as I have my hands full there as it is.  Learning PHP, learning more Prototype, and hopefully ramping up a production Rails app sometime soon.
