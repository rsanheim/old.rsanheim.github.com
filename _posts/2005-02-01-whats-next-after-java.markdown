title: Whats next after java?

I've been thinking a lot about what language I should learn next.  I certainly wouldn't call myself an "advanced" java developer, but I feel like I'm at the intermediate stage and its time to learn a mroe dynamic language.  So I've been reading up about Ruby, Python, and Lisp at places like <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki">c2</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham's</a> homepage.   In college I had some classed in Eiffel, C++, and Pascal, but nothing like a scripting language.  My idea is not to learn something I would necessarily find a job for, but to learn something to help me aquire new ways to think as a programmer.  Having a tool for rapid prototyping would be nice, also, of course.

At this point, I think I've eliminated Lisp.  It just seems a huge jump from Java and with my limited time to spend on this, I think I'd get discouraged and lose interest.  <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> might be a nice starter project to try and get up and running, and it also has the whole <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">Pragmatic Programmer</a> thing going for it.  Python seems to have an active Java subset going with Jython, which is a plus for that.  I could easily see integrating scripting into my java work at some point with that.  I believe JRuby, the Ruby implementation for Ruby, has been pretty much abandoned.

Ah well - there is always too much I want to learn and never enough time.  I think Jython might be the best way to get started, and see where it goes from there.
