Ze Frank is doing a <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/view/e_spkr/3585">keynote</a> at Rails Conf!

The rest of the newly announced speakers aren't too shabby, either.

<ul><li>David Heinemeier Hansson, Creator of Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Dave Thomas, The Pragmatic Programmers</li>
<li>Avi Bryant, Creator of Seaside</li>
<li>Tim Bray, Co-creator of XML and Atom</li>
</ul>

Still, having ze there is simply awesome.  If you've never seen <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/">the show</a>, you really should go take a look.
