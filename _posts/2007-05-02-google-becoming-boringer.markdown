title: Google Becoming Boring(er)

As Google has grown to take over the world and all of your search, it still retained some semblance of personality and quirkiness.  As much as any multi national multi-billion corporation can, anyways.  

Maybe 2007 is the year that stops, though.  Google recently renamed Froogle to <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/back-to-basics.html">"Google Product Search"</a>, and the Google personalized home page becomes <a href="https://www.google.com/ig">"iGoogle"</a>.  Could they pick names more predictable and boring?  Next thing they'll rename Gmail to "Google Online Enterprise Mail" and Docs to "Google Word 2007".  I wonder who is handling the branding - any names that sound like something Microsoft would come up with *cannot* be a good thing.
