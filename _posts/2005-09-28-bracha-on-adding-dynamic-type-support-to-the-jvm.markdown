<a href="http://bracha.org/">Gilad Bracha</a> has a very interesting <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/gbracha?entry=invokedynamic">post</a> about plans to add some support to the JVM for dynamically typed languages in the form of a <strong>invokedynamic</strong> byte code.  He also talks about how similiar the JVM and .NET JVM are, and the misnomer that is the "CLR".  Its good to see someone at Sun who recognizes the growing role dynamically typed languages will have in the future.
