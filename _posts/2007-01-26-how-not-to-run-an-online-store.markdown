Whats wrong with this picture?  Taken from the front page of <a href="http://emusic.com">emusic.com</a> - hint: there is no "browse" link.

I had heard about emusic from podcasts I listen to, and was interested to check it out as they sell DRM free music from a lot of independent artists.  That sounds like a perfect fit for me.

So I go to site, try to ignore the offer to start a "free trial" and find some way to search their selection.  I have never been to emusic before.  I have no idea if they carry artists I like or artists I've heard of or if its all just stuff I don't care about.  Just show me the music, right?  When I hit up netflix or blockbuster, I can browse their selection and immediately plan the first ten movies I'd have in my queue if I subscribe. 

After a ton of time spent searching, I finally found the music selection (go to "log in" and then "browse").  Why isn't there a "browse" link in big text, right on the front page?  A less determined visitor would have given up after about three clicks, and would never think to try to login in order to find the music.

This is a classic example of how <strong>not</strong> to do business in the "new web" - emusic is thinking of their needs and business first - more subscribers.  They should be thinking of what music fans want <strong>first</strong> - a user friendly, massive selection of music.
