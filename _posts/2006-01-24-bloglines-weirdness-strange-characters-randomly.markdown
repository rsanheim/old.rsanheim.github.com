I've noticed bloglines will occasionally display all its messages in question marks.  I'm pretty sure I never changed a language setting to Japanese or anything, so I'm a little bit confused as to how it happens.  Seems to be on different pcs and different times, so probably not related to any sort of bad cookies...

(updates: sorry if anyone sees this multiple times in rss, tweaking the image css)
