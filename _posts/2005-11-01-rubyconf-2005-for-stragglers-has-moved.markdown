If you have been looking for the audio/video from <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org/">RubyConf 2005</a> but couldn't figure out why the old link wasn't working, its because Ezra had to move the server.  The new location is <a href="http://69.10.142.222:7000/">http://69.10.142.222:7000/</a> at least until the end of November, according to Ezra.  Also check out Zen Spider's <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/Languages/Ruby/RubyConf2005.html">collection of slides</a> from the presentations.
