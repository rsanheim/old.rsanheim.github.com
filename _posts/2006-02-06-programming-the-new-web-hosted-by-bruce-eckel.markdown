Bruce Eckel is organizing a very cool looking conference called 
<a href="http://mindview.net/Conferences/ProgrammingTheNewWeb">Programming the New Web</a>.  Go check out the possible topics, but since its an <a href="http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/EnterpriseArchitectureSummit/OpenSpaces">OpenSpaces</a> conference I'm sure the conversation will ber all over the map.  Its in Colorado, so all the skiiers should be happy.  I'd be happy sitting in a lodge with some freshly brewed french press, but thats just me.
