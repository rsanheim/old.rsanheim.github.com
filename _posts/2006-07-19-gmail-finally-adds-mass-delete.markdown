I noticed today that Gmail finally added a much request feature - mass delete by label.  So say I want to delete, oh, all messages from the Struts mailing list (ahem) - just click all on the Struts page, and the option below appears.  They even have a second alert to make sure you aren't accidentally deleting a ton of important stuff, and after you delete there is an undo option.  Nicely done, and I can stop worrying about maxxing out Gmail.
