I'll be heading to Chicago in less then seven hours with <a href="https://www.jameshalberg.com">Jim </a>for No Fluff.  I wish now that I had bit the bullet and gotten an <a href="https://www.illinoistollway.com/pls/portal/url/PAGE/ISTHA/IPASSINFORMATIONPAGE/TAB34537/TAB34553">iPass</a> when I read about the increase for manual payment of tolls. (aside: the iPass url is one of the ugliest I've seen in awhile.)   Last time I went to Chicago the tolls must've ended up costing about $10, as they are about $1 a stop for manual payment.  I think ipass ends up being half that.  Those damn Illinoisian.

In other news, <a href="https://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000511.html">DHH went after</a> <a href="https://beta.asp.net/default.aspx?tabindex=7&tabid=47">Atlas</a> for copying some of the Prototype code behind the rails ajax stuff, and yet not doing as good a job of it as Rails.  Big surprise there.  He claims that MS details their auto complete in 23 pages while Ruby does it in 2 lines, but its really apples to oranges as the MS doc goes into great detail with incremental code samples for C# and VB the whole way through.  

I would never use Atlas willingly, but I'm willing to bet its a bit more capable then David and others in the Rails camp are making it out to be.  I don't think I'll be adding it to the <a href="https://www.robsanheim.com/Ajax">presentation</a> anytime soon, though. =)
