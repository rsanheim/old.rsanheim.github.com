<a href="https://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000172.html">Yahoo recently announced</a> that they increased their search index to over 20 billion pages and images indexed.  Numbers for <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> range from around 9 to 11 billion.  Somehow Yahoo has surpassed Google out of nowhere, assuming the numbers are actually accurate.  Yahoo search has been under the radar in the Google vs. Microsoft search war, but maybe its time to give them another look.  There is a <a href="https://www.langreiter.com/exec/yahoo-vs-google.html">neat page</a> (contains Flash) that compares the top 100 results for any search query on both engines.  The results for queries such as <a href="https://www.langreiter.com/exec/yahoo-vs-google.html?q=java+double+checked+locking">java double checked locking</a> or <a href="https://www.langreiter.com/exec/yahoo-vs-google.html?q=ruby+on+rails">ruby on rails</a> show that there is a lot more divergence then you would think, although the top couple results usually match.  Competition is good, right?
