Java is too easy to be the primary language taught in university computer science, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html">according to Joel.</a>  I agree.  Good thing I caught the last wave of C++ courses at <a href="http://www.uww.edu">my</a> school, so I at least learned pointers.

update: Chad <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/ThePerilsOfChoosingTheWrongToolForTheJob.rdoc,v">weighs in on it</a>, asking where is the room for non-engineers:
<blockquote>What worries me is that this will weed out the artists and the craftspeople, leaving us with nothing but a bunch of engineers. Sometimes you need an engineer. Sometimes you need an artist.</blockquote>

Now I just need to work through those <a href="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/">MIT lectures...</a> (or read the <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">book</a>).
