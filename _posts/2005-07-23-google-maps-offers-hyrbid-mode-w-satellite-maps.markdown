Google Maps has added a <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=san+diego,+ca&spn=0.060646,0.118558&t=h&hl=en">"hybrid mode"</a> which overlays the satellite view on top of the normal mapping view using PNG transparency.   It looks very cool.  Also see the short Google Blog <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/07/test-drive-this-hybrid-vehicle.html">entry</a> on it.  Via <a href="https://slashdot.org/articles/05/07/23/0237251.shtml?tid=217&tid=1">slashdot.</a>
