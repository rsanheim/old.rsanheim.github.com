Bruce Eckel wrote on <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=141312">"The departure of the hyper-enthusiasts"</a> and set of a flurry of dicussion amongst <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000551.html">DHH</a>, <a href="http://blog.curthibbs.us/articles/2005/12/19/bruce-eckel-on-ruby-and-rails">Curt</a>, and <a href="http://blog.hurleyhome.com/articles/2005/12/19/ruby-hyper-enthusiats">Patrick</a>, among others. 

I think Curt nailed the most important point that Bruce made - forget the language wars, lets just talk about the best way to solve these problems without all the baggage from the past:

<blockquote>I’m sure we will find that the Rails approach isn’t the ultimate solution; there will be plenty of other problems that we need to solve on the way to making web development easy. But it represents a fundamental restart in the thinking process.</blockquote>

Cedric also wrote on similiar themes in his <a href="http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000348.html">post on the "fan syndrome"</a>.

<a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/blogs">Stuart</a> <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/blogs/?p=92">shares some hard numbers</a> on how much more productivity he tells his clients to expect if they go with Rails over Java when doing the CRUD+Ajax web app (30-50%).  Pretty impressive coming from someone who is doing real paying rails work.

Nice <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ruby/index.html">intro article</a> on IBM's dev works site doing a ruby tutorial with java code comparisons.

Jared <a href="http://www.jaredrichardson.net/blog/2005/12/19#lisp-video">blogged a lisp tutorial video</a> that will be worth checking out once the site's speed picks up.

Del.icio.us, the essential service whose url is nearly impossible for me to type by hand, <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/continued_hiccu.html">has been having issues</a> and I'm kinda lost without it.

We've <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/2005/12/announcing_the.html">announced</a> <a href="http://www.theajaxexperience.com/index.jsp">The Ajax Experience</a> over on ajaxian.com, the official web site doesn't have the info yet but <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com">ajaxian</a> has some of the speakers listed.
