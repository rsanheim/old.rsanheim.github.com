<a href="https://www.tbray.org/">Tim Bray</a> <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/12/30/Spolsky-Recursion">weighs in</a> on the JavaSchools thing:

<blockquote>Recursion is mildly hard. Closures and continuations are hard. Concurrency is <em>very</em> hard.</blockquote>

I feel this is one of my weakpoints, but so far I haven't had any real need to dive into any serious concurrent programming.  I'm thinking sometime this year I'll just have to get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=panasonicyout-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0321349601%2526tag=panasonicyout-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0321349601%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">this</a> and maybe <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=panasonicyout-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0201310090%2526tag=panasonicyout-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0201310090%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">this</a> and dive in.

As another blogger <a href="https://www.baus.net/boolean-logic-indirection">points out</a>, Joel is really just talking about different forms of indirection.  Who cares about the tools uses to teach the concept?

Also, you gotta love the fact that Dion <a href="https://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/001121.html">calls out Joel</a> for for "whipping out crappy VB programs".  I haven't used FogBugz personally, but its always a good time to bash VB.
