This morning gave me a rare oppurtunity to catch up on feeds and do some random surfing.  The new job has meant way less time for pointless surfing, which is mostly a good thing but also means I don't get to find gems like these:

<ul><li>Danah Boyd, who is well known for her research on social communities such as <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/AAAS2006.html">MySpace</a>, <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/2005.0204.Stanford.txt">Friendster</a>, and blogs in general, has written about her <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2006/04/15/on_being_notabl.html">experience</a> in having a Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danah_boyd">entry</a> written for her.  The resulting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Danah_boyd">discussion</a> of whether she is "notable" enough to have an entry on Wikipedia, and what constitues notable for Wikipedia, is fascinating.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/">Scott Berkun</a> is a project management consultant and author who worked at Microsoft for almost ten years.  <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/?p=231">His thoughts<a /> on the whole Vista fiasco is a perspective well worth reading.</a></li>

<li>This <a href="http://davidweiss.blogspot.com/2006/04/tour-of-microsofts-mac-lab.html">tour of Microsoft's Mac lab</a> is cool, if nothing else then for its value as nerd-porn (ie pics of 150 mac minis end to end).

</li><li>Seagate <a href="http://dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=1896">leaked plans</a> for a 750 gig harddrive, so the dream of terabyte harddrives can't be more then a couple years  away.</li></ul>
