Well, our presentation at NFJS Chicago went off well.  The crowd was pretty big, we filled the largest room at the Sheraton so it must have been around 70 people.  We covered DWR, <a href="https://www.jameshalberg.com">Jim</a> covered Echo2, then I did a quick Ruby on Rails demo.  We had some good questions but not as much interaction I would've liked.  The overall evaluations were positive, but I think we could've done much better.

Things to improve on for next time:
<ul>
<li>Tell a story - we were too disorganized</li>
<li>Better handouts - I didn't realize S5 would print so poorly</li>
<li>Lots of code is good, but we should've mixed it up more for our audience</li>
<li>Increase the font size in Eclipse _before_ the presentation starts</li>
</ul>
