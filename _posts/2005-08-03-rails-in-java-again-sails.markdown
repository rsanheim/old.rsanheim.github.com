First there was <a href="https://trails.dev.java.net/">Trails</a>, now Sails.  We are going to run out of "ails" words.  Seen this morning on the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a> <a href="http://lists.rubyonrails.org/mailman/listinfo/rails">mailing list</a> posted by Adam Williams:

<blockquote>So, with fear and trembling I finally introduce Sails. It is running in a production environment but in need of lots of work. I invite anyone curious enough to learn more to communicate...</blockquote>

Go check out the <a href="http://www.javaonsails.org/" title="Java on Sails">Sails wiki</a>, though there isn't a whole lot there.  The logo sure is nice, though.  My main question: where's the code?
