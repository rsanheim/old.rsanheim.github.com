IntelliJ's plugin for Ruby is out at a 0.1 release.  The <a href="https://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/RUBYDEV/Ruby+Plugin+0.1+Release+Notes">screenshots</a> look promising, wish I had a copy of IDEA 6.0 around to try it out.

Speaking of Ruby and Java, the JavaPosse guys did a <a href="https://javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=171709">nice interview</a> with Charles and Tom from the JRuby team.   I don't think anyone even said "yea, but does it scale?" once!
