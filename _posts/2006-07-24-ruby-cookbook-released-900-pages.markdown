<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596523696/panasonicyout-20">The Ruby Cookbook</a> has been released, at least according to <a href="https://www.rubyinside.com/oreilly-releases-ruby-cookbook-906-pages-of-ruby-goodness-156.html">Ruby Inside</a>.  Over 900 pages of ruby recipes.  Sounds like a nice companion to the pickaxe book for some decent example code - seems like I could always use more help with doing things using Ruby idioms.

I've also updated my <a href="https://www.robsanheim.com/2006/03/23/ruby-and-ruby-on-rails-book-roundup/">Ruby and Rails book roundup</a> with some fixes and status updates.  There are probably quite a few newer books planned that I should add, once I get the time.
