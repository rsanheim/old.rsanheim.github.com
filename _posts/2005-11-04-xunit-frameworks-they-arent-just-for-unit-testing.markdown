I've had a discussion at my current client a few times where someone looks at a Junit test and says "this isn't a unit test, whats the deal".  The answer usually is "yea, its a functional/integration/etc test - Junit is not just for unit testing".  <a href="https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=126923">Completely isolated</a>, theoretically pure unit tests are great and essential for TDD, but don't overlook the value that comes with broader tests.  The always pragmatic Jared has a <a href="https://www.jaredrichardson.net/blog/2005/07/24#junit-isnt-unit">related post</a> that inspired this entry, and his book <a href="https://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/prj/">Ship It</a> also has a great section on  <a href="https://www.jaredrichardson.net/blog/2005/06/20/">"mock client tests"</a> as a higher level of testing then unit.
