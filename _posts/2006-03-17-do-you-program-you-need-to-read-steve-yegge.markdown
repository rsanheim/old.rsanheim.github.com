<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel on Software</a>.  <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>.  <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a>.  <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a>. 

If you are invovled in developing software and read blogs, you probably have heard of these folks.  You might add <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Scoble</a>, <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">DHH</a>, or <a href="http://www.timbray.com">Bray</a> to that list, depending upon your language/platform of choice.  

Even if you think Graham is a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SmugLispWeenie">smug Lisp weenie</a> or Joel's <a href="http://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/001121.html">software sucks</a>, I bet you still read them.  You read them because all of them are fantastic writers.  They make the art of creating software absolutely fascinating, for nerds and non-nerds alike.

Meet <a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/">Steve Yegge</a>.  If you frequent <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/">delicious/popular</a> or <a href="http://reddit.com/">reddit</a>, you probably already have seen some of his essays, and maybe you've already dived into <a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/">his site</a>.  He's formerly a developer at Amazon and has created a <a href="http://www.cabochon.com/">free online game</a> years ago that remains active (think Ultima IV crossed with a MUD).  His writing started to get picked up on the memetrackers late year, and with good reason.

He <a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/tour-de-babel.html">compares</a> programming languages, gives tips for <a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/five-essential-phone-screen-questions.html">effective phone screenings</a>, and tells you how to <a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/practicing-programming.html">practice programming</a> (you do practice, right?).  He <a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/blog-ancient-perl.html">bashes Perl</a>, <a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/anti-anti-hype.html">loves Ruby</a> and does a <a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/ruby-tour.html">nice tour</a> of its features.  He takes on the <a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/strong-weak-typing.html">static vs dynamic debate</a>, tells you <a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/why-you-should-blog.html">why you should blog</a>, <a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/ten-great-books.html">recommends</a> <a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/ten-challenges.html">books</a>, and <a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/sokoban/">surveys dynamic languages</a> on the JVM.

A <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/blog-or-get-off-pot.html">more recent essay</a> rants about the current state of blog software.  He bashes <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/">Typo</a>, the leading Ruby on Rails blog package, for all the right reasons.  I want Typo to succeed very badly, as it has so much potential.  I just don't see that happening anytime soon with the shared deployment issues, lack of documentaiton, and lack of a recent stable release.  But thats a rant for another day...

So fire up the laser printer, visit Steve's <a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/">old site</a>, and go nuts.  Then add his <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/">new blog</a> to your feadreader.  Enjoy.
