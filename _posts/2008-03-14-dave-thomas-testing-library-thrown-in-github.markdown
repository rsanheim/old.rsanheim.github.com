title: Dave Thomas' testing library (thrown in github)

Dave recently blogged a <a href="https://pragdave.blogs.pragprog.com/pragdave/2008/03/playing-with-a.html">very cool little test framework</a> he whipped up.  Its under 100 lines of code and he says he definitely does <strong>not</strong> plan on supporting it publicly.  

At the very least I intend on playing with it and incorporating some of the ideas, so I put it <a href="https://github.com/rsanheim/prag_dave_testing/tree/master">up on github.</a>  This does not constitute a release or support - I just want to watch the forks develop.

Grab it with <pre><code>git clone git://github.com/rsanheim/prag_dave_testing.git</code></pre>
