Obie has a <a href="https://jroller.com/page/obie?entry=rails_project_brain_dump">very interesting post</a> about his experience over the last two weeks with Rails.  He is a big fan of blocks for collections, the Ajax support, and the overall speed that they got a working app to the client.  Lack of IDE support hurt but wasn't that big of a deal.  More "from the trenches" posts like this would be great for getting a real feel for what Rails is like day to day, especially coming from the java world.
