	<p>Busy busy.  Blogging has falling to the bottom of the list, but I&#8217;m going to make an attempt to raise it back up, if only for five minutes a day.  News and few advanced-ish level Ruby links today.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://robsanheim.com/brain-buster">BrainBuster</a>, the little logic captcha that could, is now protecting the official <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails">Rails wiki</a>, at least until <a href="http://wikis.onestepback.org/Ruse">Ruse</a> is ready to take over.</li>
	
<li>The <a href="http://madisonrails.com">Madison Rails</a> group needs more <a href="http://madisonrails.com/wiki/pages/February+Crazy+Talks">lightning talks</a> for our next meeting</li>


		<li>Ezra has an <a href="http://brainspl.at/request_response.pdf">awesome presentation</a> on the request cycle within Mongrel/Rails, from beginnging to end, with Mongrel and Rails source.  This is the kinda presentation I love.  Wish I could&#8217;ve been at the talk for the real deal.</li>

		<li>Jay Fields handles the different eval flavors in this <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/eval-options-in-ruby">article</a> on InfoQ.</li>

		<li>Practical Ruby on <a href="http://practicalruby.blogspot.com/2007/02/ruby-metaprogramming-introduction.html">metaprogramming</a> looks worth reading.</li>
	</ul>
