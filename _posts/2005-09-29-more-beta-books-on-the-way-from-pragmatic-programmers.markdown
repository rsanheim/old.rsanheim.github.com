Its good to see that the Pragmatic Bookshelf is <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Random/MoreBetaBooks.html">continuing with beta books</a> for their future releases.  The next two releases are <em>Pragmatic Ajax</em> and <em>Enterprise Integration with Ruby</em>, both of which sound very cool.  I'm hoping the efforts to get information published quicker, in <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/fridays.html">smaller chunks</a>, and incrementally will continue and <a href="http://devnotebooks.oreilly.com/">spread</a> to other tech publishers.  <a href="http://www.robsanheim.com/2005/07/20/rails-beta-book-and-agile-book-publishing/">Agile publishing</a> really benefits everyone involved.
