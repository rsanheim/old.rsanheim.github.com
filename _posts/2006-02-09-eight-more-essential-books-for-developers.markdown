					<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t63330.html">mention</a> at <a href="https://www.javalobby.org">Javalobby</a>, I had a great response with tons of feedback to <a href="https://www.robsanheim.com/2006/02/06/five-books-every-java-developer-must-own/">my post</a> on essential books for Java developers.  From reading the comments there and at the Javalobby thread, here are some more &#8220;must-haves&#8221;.  Also, I have a crazy long <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&#038;tag=panasonicyout-20&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325&#038;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fregistry%2F3R9MUIU0TYEK1">wishlist</a> of nerdy books at Amazon that I&#8217;m trying to get through.  Only about 80 more to go!</p>

He has an <a href="https://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail82.html">interview</a> over at IT Conversations where he talks about the book and his approach to development and his thoughts on agile, among other things.</li>

The <a href="https://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/ActiveRecord">ActiveRecord</a> pattern that Rails uses comes from here, for example.  Lots of discussion regarding different ways to handle persistence, so if you are digging into ORM this would be a good book to see some of the different approaches.  (Yes, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485672/ref=nosim/panasonicyout-20/">Refactoring</a> is a classic as well&#8230;its just a bit dated now and could use an update.  Still recommended if you don&#8217;t know jack about refactoring.)</li>

Its from the source and definitely not for beginners, and covers all the 5.0 features.  If you are just getting started, pick up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=panasonicyout-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0596009208%2526tag=panasonicyout-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0596009208%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Head First Java (2nd Edition)</a> first.</li>

Developing software is hard, and developing massive software systems is incredibly hard.  The average project success (ie on budget, on time, all features) rate is <a href="https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research/chaos_1994_1.php">estimated</a> to be around 16%.  The reasons for the ridiculous failure rate was the same thirty years ago as it is today, so don&#8217;t let the age of this book scare you.</li>

	<li><a href="https://c2.com/cgi/wiki"><img class="right" src="https://c2.com/w4/wikibase/logo.gif" /></a>Finally, I have to include this non-dead-trees resource.  The <a href="https://c2.com/cgi/wiki">WikiWikiWeb</a>, aka c2, aka the Portland Patterns Repository.  This is the first wiki started by Ward Cunningham.  When you find yourself wasting time on slashdot or digg, go to c2 and pick some topic you don&#8217;t much about.  Read, learn, prosper.  One of the best general software development resources on the web.

	</p><p>Also, <a href="https://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/">Steve Yegge</a> (former Amazon, now at Google) has two great reading lists for your perusal: <a href="https://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/ten-great-books.html">Ten Great Books</a> and <a href="https://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/ten-challenges.html">Ten Challenges</a>.  </p>
	<p>I think this plus the original five makes a pretty good foundation for a developer&#8217;s library.  What else did I miss?  Other reading lists you&#8217;ve found helpful?
