It should be obvious, but its easy to forget for some of us coming from the "real" languages used on the server side.  For instance, I never considered indenting my CSS based on parent/child selectors until I read <a href="http://businesslogs.com/design_and_usability/lean_xhtml_and_precise_css.php">this article</a>.  Why not?  It makes perfect sense.  We indent for clarity and to see relationships between blocks of code, so why would css be any different?  Duh.
