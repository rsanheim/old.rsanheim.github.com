The first Madison Ruby on Rails user group is meeting tonight at <a href="http://matcmadison.edu/matc/">MATC</a> downtown.  I've heard we are expecting over thirty people, which is pretty impressive for a town where the Java user groups typically get twenty to thirty people.  The mailing list is at google groups <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Mad-Railers">here</a>, and we also have a <a href="http://www.rubyholic.com/groups/show/73">page</a> at <a href="http://www.rubyholic.com">rubyholic</a>.

Some of the bloggers attending will be <a href="http://www.almaer.com/blog/">Dion</a>, <a href="http://blog.kirkk.com/">Kirk K</a>, and <a href="http://howardlewisship.com/blog/">Howard Lewis Ship</a>.  If you attending add a comment or send an email to the group, we'll probably go out for a beer afterwards.
