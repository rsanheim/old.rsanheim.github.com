Presented at OSCON 2005:
<a href="https://onestepback.org/articles/10things/">OSCON Ten Things Every Java Programmer Should Know About Ruby</a>

I like this part:
<blockquote>This is not yet another "Ruby is better than Java" article. Nor is it intended to bash Java or Java programmers. Rather, it is an attempt to aid Java programmers who are investigating Ruby by helping them quickly get over the "Writing Java in Ruby" syndrome and to discover the Ruby Way.</blockquote>

&lt;sarcasm&gt;Wait a minute, I thought everyone had already decided Ruby was better then Java?  Isn't that a given? &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
