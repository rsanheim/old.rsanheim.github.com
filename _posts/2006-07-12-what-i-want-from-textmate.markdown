...is pretty much what <a href="http://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/001209.html">Dion</a> says.  Ctrl-click on a symbol to jump to the method/class/module/rdoc.  I miss that very much from the Java days...now its command-T, open the file, realize its the wrong file...do a search across or project or grep...etc.  Refactoring and autocomplete are hard with Ruby, I understand, but getting a basic ctrl-click plugin shouldn't be too tough for the majority of cases.

That and a better <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/articles/2006/04/19/autotest-rails">autotest</a> would be gravy...
