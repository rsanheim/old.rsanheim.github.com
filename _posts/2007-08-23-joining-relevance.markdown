I'm happy to announce that I have joined <a href="http://relevancellc.com/">Relevance</a>, a small software shop based in Chapel Hill, NC.

This is going to bring a lot of change for me and my family, one of which is moving across the country from Wisconsin to North Carolina.  I love Wisconsin and being close to family, but my wife and I have lived in Wisconsin our whole lives and are ready for some change.  Having reasonable winters will also be a nice change.  

This also brings a return to working from an office for me, instead of from home.  Working from home has been great, but so far the benefits of pair programming and being around <a href="http://relevancellc.com/2007/8/23/relevance-welcomes-glenn-vanderburg">other</a> <a href="http://relevancellc.com/2007/8/1/relevance-welcomes-jason-rudolph-as-principal-software-engineer">really</a> <a href="http://relevancellc.com/about">smart people</a> has out weighed the flexibility of working from home.
