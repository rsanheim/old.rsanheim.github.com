I saw on <a href="http://www.theserverside.com">TSS</a> that the <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/10/26/ajax-handling-bookmarks-and-back-button.html">article</a>  on the <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/projects/dhtml_history/README.html">Really Simple History</a> framework has been posted.  Matt mentioned this at his Java In Action <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/page/rd?entry=java_in_action_presentations_and">ajax presentatio</a>n as he had spent a little bit of time trying to get the framework working but didn't have enough time or documentation to get it done.  Now there are at least a couple solutions to deal with the back button/history problem (the other being <a href="http://dojotoolkit.com/">dojo</a>), so there is no reason not have that working in ajax apps.

Here's the <a href="http://www.onjava.com/lpt/a/6293">printable version</a>, all on one page with no ads.
