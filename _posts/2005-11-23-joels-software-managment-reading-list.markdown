Joel has posted a <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FogCreekMBACurriculum.html">suggested reading list</a> for his <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/11/22.html">software management training program</a>.  Lots of classic software development titles and general business titles in his list. 

I've only read five of the books, amazingly, with all the reading I do: The Mythical Man Month, Pragmatic Programmer, Microserfs, the New New Thing, and The Tipping Point.  Books I constantly pick up in the store and read through, but haven't got around to buying: Don't Make Me Think, Non-Designer's Design Book, and Peopleware.  And of course, there are a ton from there on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go/102-4282440-6610535?%5Fencoding=UTF8&type=wishlist&id=3R9MUIU0TYEK1">nerd wishlist</a> I hope to get to next year.

I did pick up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=panasonicyout-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=006093574X%2526tag=panasonicyout-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/006093574X%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" class="right" title="View product details at Amazon">The Essential Drucker</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=panasonicyout-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0452278376%2526tag=panasonicyout-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0452278376%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Managing in a Time of Great Change</a>.  I've been wanting to read Peter Drucker since I heard his <a href="http://www.onpointradio.org/shows/2004/12/20041208_b_main.asp">fascinating interview</a> on NPR's <a href="http://www.onpointradio.org/">On Point.</a>  Of course, I have about five other books going on right now, but I'm hoping the holidays will help me move more things to the "finished" pile.
