<a href="http://dathompson.blogspot.com/">D'Andrew Thompson</a> has a tutorial up on <a href="http://dathompson.blogspot.com/2005/07/rails-on-eclipse-31.html">getting started with Rails using Eclipse 3.1.</a>  Have to check this out in more detail later - it looks like they are still working on getting run support from w/i Eclipse, as you have to run the rails commands from the cmd line manually.
