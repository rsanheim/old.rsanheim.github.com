Gmail decided to freak out on me tonight.  After logging it, it would just continuously refresh the page immediately after loading.  I don't know if this means gmail is having issues, or my machine is just pissed off at me tonight, or what.  It was consistent across browsers (mac ff, safari, webkit).

So I gave up and went to Lynx.  And it worked!  Its nice to know that Lynx still works for some super charged ajax sites, even if gmail itself recommends a "fully supported" browser.
