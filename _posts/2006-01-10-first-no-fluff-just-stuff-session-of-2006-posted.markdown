The first NFJS show has been posted for 2006 for Milwaukee on Feb 24-26th.  The <a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_topics.jsp?showId=45">full session listing</a> has quite things that I either missed last year or are just new:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_session_view.jsp?sessionId=1316&showId=45">Programming Java Concurrency</a> - as I mentioned <a href="https://www.robsanheim.com/2006/01/03/bray-says-dont-forget-about-concurrency/">earlier</a>, concurrency is something I would really like to expand my knowledge on in 2006.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_session_view.jsp?sessionId=1355&showId=45">Unit Testing Best Practices</a> - I have experience with some of the things in this session, but haven't used XML Unit or DBUnit yet.  Can't say that I've had the the need, yet, though.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_session_view.jsp?sessionId=1337&showId=45">State of AOP</a> - I am a beginner re: aspects, so this session would be good for me: <blockquote>A lot is happening in the field of Aspect-oriented programming (AOP). AspectJ and AspectWerkz, the two leading AOP implementations, have merged, bringing in their respective strengths.</blockquote></li>

<li><a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_session_view.jsp?sessionId=1356&showId=45">Unit Testing java Objects with Groovy</a> - Groovy + removing test boilerplate == good</li>

<li><a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_session_view.jsp?sessionId=1352&showId=45">Losing The Battles and Winning the War: Adopting Agile</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_session_view.jsp?sessionId=1353&showId=45">Automating Business Value with FIT and FitNesse</a> - I've only read about FIT and seem examples, haven't been able to put it to use.  My main question: where does FIT fit in (hah!) if you know your users will never care about the tests?</li>

<li><a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_session_view.jsp?sessionId=1366&showId=45">Java/J2EE Architecture @ Work - EJB 3 vs Spring and Hibernate</a> - this one sounds like a lot of fun.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_session_view.jsp?sessionId=1317&showId=45">Introducing the Eclipse Rich Client Platform </a> - Something I've wanted to learn more about but just haven't got around to it yet.</li>
</ul>

<b>update: </b>also check out the <a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_agenda.jsp?showId=45">agenda</a> with session times, and <a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/show_travel.jsp?showId=45">travel info</a>.

No Fluff never disappoints, and I'm sure 2006 will not be any different.  Looking forward to it very much.
