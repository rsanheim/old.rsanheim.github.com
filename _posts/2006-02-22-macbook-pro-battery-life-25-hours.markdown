So I'm contemplating getting a MacBook Pro pretty soon, but if the <a href="http://www.powerpage.org/archives/2006/02/macbook_pro_battery_benchmarks.html">reports</a> of <a href="http://theory.isthereason.com/?p=746">2.5</a> <a href="http://vaibhav.livejournal.com/105403.html">hours</a> of battery life are accurate I may have to reconsider.  

Granted, the  <a href="http://www.powerpage.org/archives/2006/02/macbook_pro_battery_benchmarks.html">main benchmark</a> that is getting a lot of attention is a worst case scenario, where the guy didn't prep the battery and turned off hard drive spin down.  Still, I doubt doing things the right way would net much more then three hours.  Thats only a little bit better then the mediocre HP P4 laptop I use that doesn't even have a mobile processor in it.  

Before I owned a laptop I figured battery life wouldn't matter much to me.  I don't really travel much and most places I do want to use a laptop I can plug it in easy enough.  Since owning one and incorporating it into my workflow, though, I realize how great it would be to have a laptop that could just go for four or five hour - I'd be able to go code at a coffee shop without worrying about bringing the power brick.

So I'll wait and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/21/first-volley-of-macbook-pros-received/">see</a> awhile, and see what more extensive reports bring.  Maybe you can get longer life aftermarket batteries like you can with Dell and other wintels?<!--more-->
