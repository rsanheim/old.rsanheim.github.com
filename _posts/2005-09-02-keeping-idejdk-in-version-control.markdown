Do you keep a copy of your IDE in version control to use across multiple machines?  Specifically, if you were to keep Eclipse + WTP + whatever in CVS, what meta data should be included and what should be ignored.  I'd like to add my general workspace stuff to CVS to use across home, laptop, and work, but don't want to have to worry about machine specific settings getting messed in the process.  What about keeping multiple copies of the JDK for easy access (and to avoid the annoying Sun download process)?
