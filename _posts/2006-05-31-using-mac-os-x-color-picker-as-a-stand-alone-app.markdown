title: Using Mac OS X Color Picker as a stand alone app

I was just about to post this as an open question, when I actually scrolled in the google results and found this handy tip:

<a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060408050920158&lsrc=osxh">Make the Mac OS X Color Picker into an application</a>

That just makes the handy <a href="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/macosxhints/2005/09/colorpickersecrets/index.php">Mac OS X color picker</a> that much better.  Now I don't need textedit open just grab hex codes for colors, or to grab colors from screens already loaded.  Nice.
