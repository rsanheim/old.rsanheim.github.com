Last night I gave a talk on Rubygems, Bundler, and dependency management at [Raleigh.rb](http://www.meetup.com/raleighrb/ "The Raleigh-area Ruby Brigade (raleigh.rb) (Raleigh, NC) - Meetup.com").  Below is a list of references from the talk, as well as some extra guides for getting rolling with Bundler:
