title: Ruby's power + Java's tools = Smalltalk today

<a href="http://smallthought.com/avi/">Avi Bryant</a> of <a href="http://seaside.st/">Seaside</a> fame <a href="http://smallthought.com/avi/?p=8">asks:</a>
<blockquote>What if there were a Hotspot VM that ran Ruby instead of Java, without any loss of performance, and a version of Eclipse written in and for this new platform?</blockquote>

If you are familiar with Avi, you can see where he is going with this.  He goes through a brief history of the rise of Java up to the growth of Ruby on Rails today...but decries the lack of a VM and tool support:

<blockquote>Ruby has no bytecoded VM, no JIT, and no IDE that can hold a candle to Eclipse or, say, VisualWorks</blockquote>

Avi sees Smalltalk as the logical next step, combining Ruby's power with the environment and VM similiar to Java.  Having seen <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=89">Glenn's presentation</a> on Seaside, I can say that its an extremely powerful combination unmatched anywhere else.

However, if you look at things today, the fact of the matter is that Rails has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_point">tipped</a> and Seaside hasn't.  So now we just need work done on things like the <a href="rubyeclipse.sourceforge.net/">RubyEclipse</a>, <a href="http://www.atdot.net/yarv/">YARV</a>, and <a href="http://www.radrails.org/">RADRails</a>, if not <a href="http://jruby.sourceforge.net/">JRuby.</a>  Its really an exciting time to be a developer, particularily in the web app space, and I can't wait to see where things are five years from now.
