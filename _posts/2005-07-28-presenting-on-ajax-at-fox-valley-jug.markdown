<a href="https://www.jameshalberg.com">Jim </a>and I are doing our ajax presentation in Appleton, WI, tonight.  The <a href="https://boulderjug.org/viewJugMain.jsp?jugId=11">fox valley JUG</a> web site has more details.  Jim has added a very brief intro to <a href="https://www.nextapp.com/products/echo2/">Echo2,</a> nothing too substantial.  I changed the DWR sample a little bit to match JSON, but now that I've finished moving I should have time to make some of the larger changes I've wanted to do.  Should be fun tonight.
