title: Ruby on Rails for Java Programmers - PDF finally uploaded

About seven months I did a presentation for the various Wisconsin Java User Groups introducing Ruby and Rails to Java programmers.  It was a nice, friendly presentation comparing code between Ruby and Java, and I had some fun discussions with some of the attendees looking to sneak Ruby into their Java shops.

When I <a href="https://www.robsanheim.com/2006/05/01/ruby-on-rails-for-java-programmers-wisconsin-user-groups/">posted</a> about it I promised to upload the pdf of the slides shortly after.  Well, things happened, I had server issues when I tried to upload the file, and then I got busy and it dropped to the bottom of my action list.

<strong>My bad.</strong>  <a href="https://www.robsanheim.com/wp-content/ruby_on_rails_for_java_programmers.pdf">Here are the slides in pdf format.</a>  Note that the Rails snippets will be out of date, as this was before 1.1 and all that.
