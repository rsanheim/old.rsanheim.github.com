title: Packing up for the Ajax Experience

Well, almost everything is packed for the flight out to SF for the <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/welcome-to-the-ajax-experience">Ajax Experience</a> tomorrow.  I've got MarsEdit freshly installed, so hopefully I'll be able to keep up with the sessions and do some decent summaries for ajaxian.  I see that San Francisco is supposed to have a high around 70 with sun both days, while Madison weather basically shows 50s and rain for the next week or so.  If nothing else, it will be nice to get out of the dreary mess here for a few days.

My next conference will be <a href="http://www.railsconf.org">Rails conf</a>, and after that I'm hoping to take a trip that doesn't revolve around programming.  Sitting on a beach reading books (for fun even!) sounds very nice...

Any good recommendations for non-Starbucks coffee shops within walking distance of the Westin St Francis?
