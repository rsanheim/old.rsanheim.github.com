(Found via <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/">redhanded</a>) A nice post showing a one-liner using ActiveRecord to search and replace through all records of a table, including the db save.  Has a nice explanation of blocks: <a href="http://bohnsack.com/2005/08/15/oneliner-with-rails-and-activerecord/">A One-liner with Rails and ActiveRecord</a>.
