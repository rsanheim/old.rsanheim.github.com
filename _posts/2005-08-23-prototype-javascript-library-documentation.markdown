title: Prototype JavaScript library documentation

Sergio Pereira has written up some very nice <a href="https://www.sergiopereira.com/articles/prototype.js.html">unofficial documentation</a> for <a href="https://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>, the leading javascript library for Ajax applications.  Its also the library underneath <a href="https://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails'</a> ajax support.  Sergio has even done some API style docs for the major objects.  Definitely worth a print out.

Aside: what is up with the <a href="https://script.aculo.us/">script.aculo.us</a> server?  Every other time I try to check out the demos or wiki there, its not responding.  Do they just need to upgrade the server?
