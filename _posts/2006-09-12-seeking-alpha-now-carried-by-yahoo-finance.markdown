Today was a great day for Seeking Alpha (ie my employer).  Our content is <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/seekingalpha/">now carried</a> by Yahoo Finance (details <a href="http://internet.seekingalpha.com/article/16585">here</a>).  Kudos go to <a href="http://almaer.com/blog/">Dion</a> and <a href="http://jameshalberg.wordpress.com/">Jim</a> moreso then me.  I've been working on Rails-ication of the back end, and also integration of some other Ruby pieces, so I haven't really done any of the stuff that talks to Yahoo.  Some of my work should be running in production, very soon, though...
