            <a href="https://www.waterfall2006.com">Waterfall 2006</a> looks like its shaping up to be a great conference.  I can't wait for <a href="https://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/001133.html">Dion's talk</a>, and I'll also be joining him for a couple new Ajax talks:

Ajax: Why Its Impossible to Test, and Why You Shouldn't Even Try
Ajax Effects: Web 2.0's Blink Tag

Also, <a href="https://www.waterfall2006.com/beck.html">WordUnit</a> looks to be the next big thing in testing.  I've been trying to find a way to keep all my documentation fully tested in a repeatable, automated way.  It looks like we finally have a solution.
