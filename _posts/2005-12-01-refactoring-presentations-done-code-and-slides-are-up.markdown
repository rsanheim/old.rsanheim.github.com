The presentations went pretty well in Milwaukee and Chicago, despite a low turn out.  Apparently the organizer had some mail problems so members of the WJUG/MADJUG list only got notice the day off, or not at all.  Milwaukee we had about five people, and Madison was maybe ten or so.  So not the best turn out, but thats fine - the audience I did have was receptive and had some good questions for discussion.

I've <a href="http://www.robsanheim.com/refactoring_presentation/">posted</a> the slides, example code, and a few book references for the presentation.  The slides might not make much sense as I used a <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/10/the_lessig_meth.html">Lessig</a> inspired approach.

Notes for next time:
* need a better wireless remote for quick slide progressions
* more time practicing slides needed
* figure out how to incorporate discussion/questions without losing flow
