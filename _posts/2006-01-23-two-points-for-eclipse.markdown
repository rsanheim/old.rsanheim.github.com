<a href="https://www.javaddicts.net/blog">Mathias</a> wrote about <a href="https://www.javaddicts.net/blog/index.php/2006/01/16/eclipse-vs-idea-making-the-switch/">why he is switching to IDEA</a>.  From talking with IDEA users and watching demos at conferences, its obvious that IDEA has the polish and finish that Eclipse + web tools + duct tape doesn't.  

However, Eclipse has two key points going for it that keep me loyal:  <ol><li>Eclipse has dominant market share.  If you are doing consulting or contracting with clients who use WSAD or Eclipse, coming in with your own IDE is often not an option.</li><li>Plugins: <a href="https://www.radrails.org/">RadRails</a>, <a href="https://www.phpeclipse.de/">PHPEclipse</a>, <a href="https://rubyeclipse.sourceforge.net/">Ruby Dev Tools</a>, and <a href="https://springide.org/project">SpringIDE</a> are without an equivalent in IDEA.  Point #1 means that Eclipse will remain the leader in the plugin war.  This will be key as experienced Java developers increasingly turn towards using  non-Java languages, either as a wholesale replacement for selected apps or for bits and pieces while talking to core Java on the same JVM.</li></ol>
