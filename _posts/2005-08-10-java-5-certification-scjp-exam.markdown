Thomas De Vos, the <a href="https://www.javacertificate.com/">java certificate</a> dude, has a <a href="https://www.javacertificate.com/blogger/page/thomas/20050809#java_5_tiger_your_certification">handy little page</a> of hints for what to look out for if you are going to take the Java 5 certification exam.  Kathy Sierra also <a href="https://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2004/12/update_new_sun_.html">blogged</a> about the major changes that went into the exam a little while ago.  This changes seem for the better as the exam is more about development then memorization, as Kathy summarizes:

<blockquote>...the ability to memorize is far less of a help now than the ability to write, evaluate, and troubleshoot code.</blockquote>

There is also a <a href="https://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=24&t=028170">quick thread</a> on <a href="https://www.javaranch.org">Javaranch</a> by the other creator, Bert, on the changes from 1.4 to 5.  I see on Sun's page that the <a href="https://www.sun.com/training/catalog/courses/CX-310-056.xml">upgrade exam</a> is finally available, so maybe I'll look into that later this year after <a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff.com">NFJS</a> and the wedding.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0596007388&tag=panasonicyout-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Java 5.0 Tiger: A Developer's Notebook</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=panasonicyout-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596007388" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> might come in handy as well.
