I heard Adam Corolla's farewell show for <a href="https://www.dolland.net/loveline/">Loveline</a> a little while ago.  No matter who they get to replace him, it just won't be the same.  I can't imagine the show being the same without Adam's rants and constant abuse of Drew.  You'll be missed, Adam.
