This last weekend was very productive, even though we slept in pretty late everyday.  Yesterday, I finally got the office overhauled - brought up a much larger table, moved things  around, set up my nicest two monitors for my pc.  Now I'm finally ready to get a "development" server up and running with tomcat/apache/subversion/etc.  My long term plan is to get a linux server up for that purpose, but considering how limited my experience is with linux I don't think thats realistic right now.

Anyways, I got work to finish up...
