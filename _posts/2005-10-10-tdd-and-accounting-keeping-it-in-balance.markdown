Bob Martin has a very good <a href="http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheSensitivityProblem">post</a> about how the tests in TDD are analagous to debits and credits in accounting.  I really like the analogy of double bookkeeping to tests, and though I've read it before Martin's post really hits home at the "sensitivity" of software and accounting and why we need the tests.
