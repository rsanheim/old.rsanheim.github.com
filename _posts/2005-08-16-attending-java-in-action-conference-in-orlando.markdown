I have all my reservations lined up for the <a href="https://www.javainaction.com">Java in Action</a> conference.  Its at the <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/resorts/resortLanding?id=YachtClubResortLandingPage">Disney Yacht Club</a> in Orlando this October 5 - 7th.  It looks like <a href="https://www.theserverside.com">The Server Side's</a> attempt to do a sort of <a href="https://www.nofluffjuststuff">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> type conference.   It will be interesting to see what kind of turn out it gets, as I haven't seen it get much press beyond the announcement on TSS.

<a href="https://www.almaer.com/blog/">Dion's</a> three hour session on <a href="https://javainaction.techtarget.com/html/det_trainingmodules.htm#Scripting">Scripting Languages on Enterprise Projects</a> looks pretty good, as does <a href="https://raibledesigns.com/">Matt's</a> <a href="https://javainaction.techtarget.com/html/det_trainingmodules.htm#JavaWeb">Web Framework Comparison.</a> (too bad he doesn't have Rails in there...)  Some of the other sessions I plan on going to are the <a href="https://javainaction.techtarget.com/html/det_techsessions.htm#SpringFrame">Spring case study</a>, <a href="https://javainaction.com/html/det_techsessions.htm#E2E">Java End-to-End Testing</a>, and the <a href="https://javainaction.com/html/det_techsessions.htm#Drools">session on Drools.</a>  Drop a line or trackback if you are planning on attending...
