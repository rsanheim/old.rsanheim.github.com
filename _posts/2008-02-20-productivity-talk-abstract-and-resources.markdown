Thanks to everyone who came out to Raleigh.rb last night for my talk.  You can <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/raleighrb/~3/238194153/2008-02-19_productivity.mp3">hear the talk (mp3 ~25 mb)</a> thanks to <a href="https://matthewbass.com">Matthew Bass</a>.  The sound quality is decent considering it was just recording right into his macbook.

I've posted more details from the talk, the abstract, and references (books, tools, etc) at the <a href="/i-can-has-productivity/">main "can has productivity" page</a>.
