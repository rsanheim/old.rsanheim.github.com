<p>Today was one of those days where I was just in the zone.  I was under pressure to get some changes into production on a system for check-in tonight, and I just put my head down and got it done.  Half of that battle is just getting started, like Joel talks about in <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html" title="">Fire and Motion</a>, and I managed to really get started by 10 am.  Going into work this morning I figured it would be a fairly empty day, with two days left at my current place and going on about four hours of sleep.  The coffee combined with some Botch and other assorted breakneck music just turned it on.</p>

<p>I&#8216;m amazed at how many developers at my current place are ignorant of the standard Java api&#8216;s.  We have so many utility methods lying around in our codebase that just duplicate things that have been in the <span class="caps">API</span> since 1.2.  Version 1.2 came out at least what, three years ago?  Oh well&#8230;</p>

<p>A friend of mine runs a baseball fan site in his spare time that has uses just about every single framework I want to get into, including Hibernate, Struts, Spring, and SiteMesh.  I&#8216;m extremely jealous.  Not sure how he finds the time for it.  Then again, he doesn&#8216;t have a two and a half year old who runs around screaming like a banshee to keep him busy.</p>
