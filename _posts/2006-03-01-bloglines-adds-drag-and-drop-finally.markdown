<img class="right" src='/wp-content/bloglines_improves.png' alt='bloglines drag and drop improvements' />If you read a lot of feeds via <a href="https://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>, you'll know how painful managing your folders has been with the very old school interface.  I noticed today that things have finally improved - real <a href="https://www.bloglines.com/about/news#97">drag and drop</a> and some prettier icons, too!  No longer will I dread organizing feeds only because the UI sucks so much.  Thank you, bloglines, please keep the improvements coming...
