Here are some tips for how to drive your fellow developers nuts using your favorite change management system:

<ul>
	<li>Never log your changes.  If you are pair programming or having daily meetings you can just tell all your coworkers what your changes were - don't wanna violate DRY!</li>
	<li>If you do put in a commit message, include your initials, date, time, filename, weather conditions, last good movie you saw, thoughts on where to go out for lunch, and current phase of the moon.</li>
	<li>Or, commit sweeping changes to 45 files all with the same comment: "changed the foo baz system".</li>
	<li>Set up your IDE so that your formatting is completely different from the rest of the team, so that everytime you touch a file you will have some extra tabs or line breaks to commit.</li>
	<li>Commit whitespace/line break changes.</li>
         <li>Commit code that works in your favorite JDK version when you know that your coworkers are all still using an older version (I'm guilty of this one recently).</li>
	<li>Commit half of a major refactoring effort, and leave to go on vacation.  Turn off your cell phone the moment you leave the office.  Laugh as you drive away.</li>
	<li>Commit Ruby on Rails code when you are on a Java project.  When questioned, act completely shocked that you are on a Java project.</li>
	<li>Commit code that compiles, but causes tests to fail (if it compiles, ship it!).</li>
	<li>Commit code that compiles and tests fine, but breaks when run in the production environment (green bar, ship it!).</li>
</ul>

If you put at least a few of these handy hints into practice, I guarantee that your team members will be ready to beat you down by the bike shed by quitting time!
