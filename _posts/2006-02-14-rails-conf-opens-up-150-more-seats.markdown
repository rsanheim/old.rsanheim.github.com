title: Rails Conf opens up 150 more seats

If you missed the mad rush on <a href="http://www.railsconf.com">Rails Conf</a> registration (400 seats sold out in less then a week), run, don't walk, to the <a href="http://www.railsconf.org/pages/registration">registration site</a>.  They have opened up 150 more seats.  I wouldn't be surprised if it sold out today.

side note: I think the banner on the <a href="http://railsconf.org/">front page</a> takes the 'big is good' design mantra a bit too far.
