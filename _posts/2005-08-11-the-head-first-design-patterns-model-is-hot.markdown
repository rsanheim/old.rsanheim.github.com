If there is one thing <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=2&url=http%3A//headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/&ei=35j7Qs7QFJucigHiqNws">Kathy Sierra</a> and <a href="https://www.wickedlysmart.com/">crew</a> know how to do, its how to market their books.  I guarantee their covers get a ton more attention then <a href="https://images.amazon.com/images/P/0201633612.01._BO2,204,203,200_PIlitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,32,-59_AA240_SH20_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg">this</a>, for instance.  They are getting plenty of free advertising from bloggers, like me and <a href="https://twasink.net/blog/archives/2005/08/your_brain_on_d.html">Robert Watkins</a>, for instance.

Anyways, I bought it for the content (really), and I'm about halfway through.  So far it maintains the high quality all the Head First books have.  A few of the chapters could've gone more into the potential downsides of using the patterns (ex: Template Method), but the description and diagrams are great even for developers who "know" all the patterns.  I've read the GoF book and consider myself to know most of the patterns to some degree, and I still am learning things from the Head First book.  Recommended.
