I've created a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?q=Lucky+Lab+Pub+&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF-8&client=firefox-a&hl=en&om=1&msa=0&msid=114020005267647365662.00000112759eaf576f3c8&ll=45.527426,-122.66304&spn=0.028772,0.041113&z=15">RailsConf google map</a> with some things near the convention center that attendees might be interested in.

I have some local restaurants, brew pubs, Powells, the bike rental place, a mac shop, the Jupiter hotel, and a couple coffee shops.  

Any suggestions for additions?  Or maybe its publicly editable?  I'm not really sure how that works...
