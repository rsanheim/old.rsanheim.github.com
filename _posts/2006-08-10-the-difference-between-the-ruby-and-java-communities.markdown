Ruby has people like <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/">why</a> and <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/">Dr. Nic</a>, and blogs like the <a href="http://railsblob.blogspot.com/">Rails Blob.</a>

Java has Hani and the <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/fate">Bile Blog.</a>

I know which one I'd rather be a part of.
