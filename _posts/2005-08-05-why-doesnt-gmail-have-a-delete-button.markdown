I'm sure they have gotten tons of requests for it, and I know you can <a href="http://www.arantius.com/article/arantius/gmail%20delete%20button/">add</a> it via <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">GreaseMonkey</a> (although some people have been <a href="http://www.rootburn.com/2005/06/lockdown-in-sector-4.html">locked out</a> their accounts after using it).  I can't imagine why the Gmail developers wouldn't just add it, I'm sure Google has the resources and it can't be too difficult.
