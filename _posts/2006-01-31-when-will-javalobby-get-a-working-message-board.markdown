You know, I'd like to read discussions like <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t62801.html">this one</a>, but its pretty much pointless if you have to click on each and every of the 80-some messages to try and follow the conversation.  There are a ton of free open source message board systems out there, and I know I've read other people complain about this.  C'mon guys, is it that hard to match The Server Side's sterling example of usability?
