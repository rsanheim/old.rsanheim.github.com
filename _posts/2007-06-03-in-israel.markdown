I'm in Israel.  Its crazy times.

We saw Masada, the Dead Sea, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem.  We are staying three blocks from the Mediteranenan.  

For day to day reports, you could see <a href="https://jimhalberg.blogspot.com/">Jim's blog</a> (my <a href="https://seekingalpha.com">Seeking Alpha</a> colleague).  

If you haven't got overseas and you are American, you should do so.  As soon as possible.  The Caribbean doesn't count.  Get to Europe, or the Middle East, or the Africa or Australia.

I feel like I've just begun exploring.
