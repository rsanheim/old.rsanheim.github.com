<a href="http://brainspl.at/">Ezra</a> has posted a <a href="http://brainspl.at/rails_stack.html">great tutorial</a> for how he gets up and running on <a href="http://www.rimuhosting.com">rimuhosting.com</a> with Rails, lighty, mysql, and a bunch of other pieces.  It seems that the current Rails production stacks don't play nicely on shared hosting models like Textdrive and Dreamhosting, so a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vps">VPS</a> like rimuhosting has is the best way to go.

I'm running White Hat on my rimuhosting box, but I'm hoping I'll be able to use most of the insturctions in the tutorial - though I might try to get fcgi working within apache, since I'm already pretty happy with it.
