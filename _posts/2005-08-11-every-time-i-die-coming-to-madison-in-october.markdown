<a href="https://www.everytimeidie.com/">Every Time I Die</a> is <a href="https://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=5296">coming to Madison</a> on October 18th, and that makes me happy.  Their latest album was a little bit of a letdown after the classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=manalangcom-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B00005NKI3%2526tag=manalangcom-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B00005NKI3%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">"Last Night in Town"</a>, but I also see they have a new lp later this month.  "Last Night..." was a nearly perfect mix of frenzied metal and hardcore and is easily one of my favorite hardcore/metal/whatever albums.
