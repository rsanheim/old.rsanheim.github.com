Paul Graham has a <a href="https://paulgraham.infogami.com/blog">new blog</a> over at <a href="https://www.infogami.com">Infogami.</a>  Its a more a typical blog compared to the essays at his <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com">main site.</a>  I'm digging this:
<blockquote>...There are thousands of smart people who could start companies and don't, and with a relatively small amount of force applied at just the right place, we can spring on the world a stream of new startups that might otherwise not have existed.

...what motivates us is the completely amoral desire that would motivate any hacker who looked at some complex device and realized that with a tiny tweak he could make it run more efficiently. In this case, the device is the world's economy, which fortunately happens to be open source.</blockquote>
