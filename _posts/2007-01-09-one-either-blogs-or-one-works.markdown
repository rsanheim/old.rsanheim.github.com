In my case, I suppose its One either blogs or one works.  Not a whole lotta blogging here lately.

In other news, <a href="https://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">RailConf 2007</a> is coming.  Also, the <a href="https://madisonrails.com">Madison Ruby</a> group is meeting informally this Thursday and has a real meeting on the 22nd.  If you are in the area do join us.
