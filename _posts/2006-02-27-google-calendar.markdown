Maybe its for <a href="https://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2006-02-27-n25.html">real</a> this time.  <a href="https://www.paulstone.net/">Paul Stone</a> did the original <a href="https://www.paulstone.net/google_links_and_calendar">snooping</a> in the Gmail code which turned up <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=barc">links</a> with the mysterious "calendar for you and the world".  Lets up this is more like gmail or maps and less like google reader or pages.
