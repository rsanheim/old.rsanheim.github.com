The wireless sucks and not much time, so here are some random thoughts near the end of Day two:

<ul>
<li>Over 90% of attendees have macs.  Literally.  Crazy.</li>
<li>no free audio/podcasts from the sessions == lame</li>
<li>otherwise, the production quality has the usual high <a href="https://nofluffjuststuff">Jay</a> standards</li>
<li>just about everyone is here, except Matz</li>
<li>what other programming community has its own rockstar with insane cartoons and crazy hacks?  I just wish Why's music was a little less random and bit more bumping - lots of interesting hooks that sounded like they could be IDM/hip-hop-ish if laid over better beats</li>
<li>aren't we tired yet of picking on Java, or is it just the permanent dog to kick around?</li>
<li>the keynote lineup is all-star -> Fowler, Graham, DHH, and Dave Thomas</li>
<li>seems like the venue is a bit overbooked, with the most popular sessions overflowing out of the rooms</li>
<li>given the attendance here, RubyConf 06 will probably sell out in less then a day, if they really limit to ~240 people</li>
<li>the hipster nerd to D&D nerd ratio is pretty high here, much higher then java shows</li>
<li>Manheim Road is a pedestrian/new-urban planner's hell</li>
</ul>
