A good list of <a href="http://www.brianshih.com/2006/01/30/5-things-to-improve-your-blog/">five ways</a> to improve your blog in under an hour, by <a href="http://www.brianshih.com/2006/01/30/5-things-to-improve-your-blog/">Brian Shih.</a>  The five things are: use feedburner, ping aggregators, fix your typography, use spell check (does spellbound work on FF 1.5.1?)  and just write something!  

I would add: write an about page with a brief bio and maybe a picture.  Too many blogs are missing this, and its very annoying to not have any idea who the author is.  If you can't take the time to write a blurb about yourself, I'm not going take the time to follow your feed everday.
