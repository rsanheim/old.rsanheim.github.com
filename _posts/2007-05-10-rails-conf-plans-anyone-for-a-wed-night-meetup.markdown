I'll be in Portland for a week, for Rails Conf plus a few days of vacationing.  Would anyone be up for a meetup or hackfest Wednesday night, maybe just to have a few beers and kick things off?

Man of Action <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/">Dr Nic</a> doesn't sit around waiting for things to happen.  He makes them happen with sheer force of will (+ code).  He bends spoons and dreams of Rails plugins.
