<a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6210240/">Olbermann's editorial</a> on the response to Katrina.  He sums up the tragedy of the last week quite well.

Regarding Bush: <blockquote>All that was needed was just a quick "I'm not satisfied with my government's response." Instead of hiding behind phrases like "no one could have foreseen"...</blockquote>

And of course the hilarity of a statement like "I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees."  Guess he said "anybody" where he meant "I", as just about everyone else knew those levees were not up to task.

There is a <a href="https://media.putfile.com/OlbermannSwings">video clip of the whole editorial</a> if you would rather watch it, looks to require windows media player.
