Tor Norbye is about the last person I'd guess would be pushing the state of Ruby IDE's.  But <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/tor/entry/netbeans_and_ruby_is_true">he is</a>.  If you ever listen to the Java Posse, he doesn't even seem to like dynamic languages.  Or maybe its just that he seems to really like statically typed languages.  Maybe they gave the Ruby work to him as punishment. *  Go Tor!  (via <a href="https://headius.blogspot.com/2006/11/netbeans-ruby-awesome.html">Hedius</a>)
