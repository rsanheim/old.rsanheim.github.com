There has to be a tool or script out there that can do the following, given the root of your web app:

<ul>
	<li>validate XHTML according to the doctype</li>

	<li>validate CSS</li>

	<li>validate Javascript syntax</li>

	<li>check all links to ensure they return an OK status code (recursively if desired)</li>
</ul>

I know there are plenty of ways to do each of these steps with different tools, but hasn't someone put together a nice open source script that can do all these things in your <a href="https://www.pragmaticautomation.com/">automated builds</a>?  This seems like such a basic test to get in place at the start of any web project, yet I couldn't turn up anything with google or at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a>.
