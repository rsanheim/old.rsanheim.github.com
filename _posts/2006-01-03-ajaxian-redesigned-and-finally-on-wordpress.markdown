Yay!  We finally got <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com">Ajaxian</a> <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ajaxiancom-redesigned-for-2006">updated</a> with a new design and converted to Wordpress from Movable Type.  The redesign is great and long over due, but even more important to me is to not have to deal with the horrible Movable Type admin interface.  After getting used to Wordpress' admin interface with my blog, it was painful going to MT.  Small buttons everywhere, very easy to accidentally publish drafts, pop up windows for categories and uploads, yuck.  Wordpress isn't perfect, but its a far ahead of MT in terms of admin usabilty.
