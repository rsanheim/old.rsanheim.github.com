Gave my two weeks notice today.  Its time to move on.  In two weeks I'm starting as a contracter working through local consulting firm.  My first contract will be at an insurance company, doing web development.  Finally have a chance to use some newer (to me) technologies  at work...and not just play around with them at home.  A friend of mine followed the same path about six months ago, and he has been very happy.

Onward, ho.
