Whats wrong with this picture?

Do we really need links (or <a href="https://www.wordspy.com/words/chiclet.asp">chiclets</a>) to TEN different social bookmarking services?  I'm not even sure what half of those icons are for, even though I read quite a few of them.  If I'm the type of person who submits things to digg or reedit, I probably have the bookmarketlet in my toolbar anyways.  Feedburner has a pretty good <a href="https://www.mattmcalister.com/blog/_archives/2005/12/7/1439361.html">solution</a> to the feedreader chiclet problem.  The problem is it wouldn't really work for individual posts without some sort of common preference that says "I always bookmark with delicious".

Offering one or two chiclets for the most <a href="https://del.icio.us/">common</a> <a href="https://digg.com">services</a> I can understand, but offering an icon for every possible social service is just noise.
