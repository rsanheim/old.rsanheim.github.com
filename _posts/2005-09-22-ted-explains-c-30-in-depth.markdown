Ted has a <a href="https://blogs.tedneward.com/2005/09/22/Language+Innovation+C+30+Explained.aspx">nice post</a> going into detail explaining all the new featuers coming for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/future/">C# 3.0</a>.  Lots of very cool things including lamba expressions, extension methods, and implicity typed local variables.  The big takeaway point is that all the stuff could be done in Java on the JVM, but Sun just isn't pushing things in that direction.  Its really quite a shame, and does not bode well for Java's future.
