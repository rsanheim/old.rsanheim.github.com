It feels good to launch these <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/17725">new forums</a> for Seeking Alpha.  Its a modified <a href="https://beast.caboo.se">Beast</a> installation, with a bunch of hackery going on so it understands our old user system.  Beast is a really great Rails forum, with a clean look and nice use of ajax done in under 500 lines of code (though I'm sure my changes pushed it over that).  There are a few minor spots where things could be better setup to allow this kind of integration (ie a central config object), but then again its not very hard it to do it yourself.

Now the fun part - on to version 1.1 by end of day.  I've already got a list of usability things to work on...
