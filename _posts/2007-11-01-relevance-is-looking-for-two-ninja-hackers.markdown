My company, <a href="https://thinkrelevance.com">Relevance</a> is <a href="https://relevancellc.com/2007/10/31/relevance-is-hiring-two-developers">looking to hire</a> two more full time people.  We are based in Chapel Hill, and we want everyone to be colocated or open to relocation.

In my short tenure here at Relevance (little over three months), I can safely say that this is the closest I've ever been to my perfect job: a small team with really smart people, colocated, doing agile with the best tools, and having a blast building cool stuff.

If you are at RubyConf and are interested in Ruby work, please come say hi to one of us.  <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/robsanheim/1674497405/">Here</a> is a picture of me in case you are looking for me at the show.  This was taken right before I tore a bear apart with my bare hands and a plastic spork.
